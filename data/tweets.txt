@Kiyoon this guy is so negative : ( @setsukotft
I'M PLAYING IN DAY 1 : (
"I was watching k3soju last night for a bit, hanging out with my wife. His stream is such a unique experience compared to every other stream, which honestly is really smart when trying to create a successful stream. Which is funny because that's not his goal. He's clearly just vibing and averaging a 5.0, which is always hilarious to see.

It got me thinking about how much he's changed over the last few years, and how much we've watched him demote to gm from challenger, rage about game balance, climb back for snapshots off stream, and do it all again the next week. In a way, streaming has allowed us to watch him grow up along the way. It's something that wasn't really possible 10-15 years ago.

And that's something new for hate watchers that is extremely powerful. The ability to, at almost any time of day, spam emotes mocking steamers of your favorite game. The amount you can laugh at any time is almost overwhelming, but so insanely valuable. And the fact that he drops these streams for 24 hours a day is insane!

Anyway, to k3soju or to any influencer who runs it down on stream, even for just an hour, thank you. Watching players like you, even if you don't know, helps us realize this game is not that serious, and gives us motivation to keep on going. Thank you.

That's it for me this week. Have a good weekend, and take it easy :)"

"️ @maikeltft Charity Stream ️

Chile has been devastated by severe forest fires throughout the weekend, with over 60+ dead and @maikeltft's family losing absolutely everything due to the fire.

Due to the fire @maikeltft was unable to play in the Grand Finals of @TFT LATAM's league circuit, and I think it's absolutely shameful for the TOs(ESL) not to have even considered the possibility of suspending or delaying the 8 player finals considering the tragedy that was going on at the time.

In my opinion Maikel is not only one of the most talented @TFT players in the world but also a player with an incredibly kind heart and it's tragic to see him having to deal with this. 

If you have the time to support him throughout his stream or the means to donate to the cause of helping the victims rebuild their lives, I'm sure he would greatly appreciate it! There will be giveaways and other fun activities throughout the stream(for spanish speakers mostly ofc)!

@Sarsarcha @Noorthevirgo ....?
"TLDR - We're lowering item drop variance in 14.3 as we head into the final leg of the competitive season, and then will be launching a larger scale update to in game loot distribution in 14.5

TFT is the kind of game that is most fun and successful when every time you play, the game feels a bit different, and you get a unique experience. Much like the roguelike genre, that game to game variance keeps each time you play unique and full of wonder. What type of game will it be this time?

Over the years, we've found more and more successful systems that have successfully added this variance. Augments and Portals right now especially change up each game in unique ways, and the combinatorics mean there are so many potential unique experiences.  The shop alone accomplishes this in a big way as well.

But as we add these systems and outcomes, it's important to realize that not EVERY system needs to be something that increases potential outcomes. If the scope of possibilities gets too wild, then the game will reach a point where it's almost unlearnable except by the most hard core. As an example, imagine if every game the amount of XP to reach each level was randomized. That would likely be too much.

This leads us to items and loot orbs. Back, long before we even had augments, we relied on the orb drop system to be one of those sources of variance. Some games you might get a spatula, some games you'll get more gold than items, etc. And it worked for a time. But as players have gotten better at the game, their understanding of fair has changed as well. Being down two components but up 12 gold on 2-1 is no longer variance, but just unfairness as we understand truly which outcome can be optimized better.

We still want there to be SOME variance in the systems output, but likely a whole lot less since we've been able to add that needed variance in other places. So we've been working on a fairly large change to the system that will include some surprises, and lead to more fair but still variant game experiences.

The challenge is, that system will be ready for patch 14.4 at the earliest. That's the Remix Rumble Championship patch. Probably not a good idea to launch a system overhaul that patch. So instead we will be aiming for the patch right after, 14.5. Makes sense. But in the mean time, this would mean no changes before the main competitive season, and right now this system is bearing the brunt of the perceived unfairness at the highest level.

So as a temporary measure, in 14.3 we will take the current system and lower it's max item variance from 2 to 0. The short version of what this means is that all players will always have the same number of item components, and essentially gold starts are gone. It will leave the overall system a bit more bland than we'd like (though not completely, gold orb drops still exist), but for 2 patches late into the set and to help competitive integrity, the trade off is worth it.

I look forward to sharing the details of the changes in the future, but for now, this should make for another exciting competitive circuit where the best players can really shine. Until then, take it easy :)"

@setsukotft  - Very Single 

LET ME TELL YA, your entire romance life until this point has been a waste. 
Introducing my boy… Setsuko 
 
Location: Summoner's Rift & your heart 
Ethnicity: Chinese
Height: 5’2
Age: 24
 
Pros:
Athletic AF. is a professional ATHLETE (esports). BUT DW HE WONT PLAY YOU
Low-key famous, he has hordes of (e)girls chasing after him 
The most chill guy I’ve ever met, has a super soothing voice and the cutest laugh
Loves making food and food photography. He can be your instagram bf 
 
Cons:
Can’t get drunk, but will always be down to grab a drink with you   (Will always take care of you though!) UWU
 Has a whack sleep schedule so you’ll never see each other 
“Only” 5’2” BUT THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE MEASUREMENTS, if you know what I mean 
 
Looking for:
Someone to hang with (music, sports, gaming, going out to eat) BONUS if you will play TFT with him  
 Wholesome, kind-hearted, and open-minded
 
BETTER SLIDE INTO HIS DMS QUICK, HE WON’T BE ON THE MARKET FOR LONG! 

Qei'vin ""Setsuko"" Xian (Chinese: 李賢; pinyin: Qǐ'Vin Set'Zuko Xián) (655 BC – 684 BC), was a crown prince of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. He was known for being a Go master, the official board game of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He became ranked 2 Go in 675 after his older sister E'ma Lee Wang, who lovingly refers to him as ""xiao bro"", but soon fell out of favor with the general public due to his public rants and antics and was exiled to ancient Tibet to become a bald monk. His height is 5'2."

@Gangly_ @pockygom PRETTY SURE THERE IS ONLY ONE ICONIC MOMENT AND THATS IN SET 5 REGIONALS WHEN SPENCER PLAYED DRACONIC FOR 1 TURN AND GOT THE BIG EGG AND SCAMMED HIM FROM WORLDS.
My thoughts on @k3soju from set 7 to set 9. https://t.co/lG74gwe1zu
"I think @Dishsoaptft  will be the best player going into regionals. Anything else besides qualifying to worlds would be a huge let down. 

Essentially unanimously considered the best player on the server, he currently holds the record for most consecutive DTIYDK power rankings in the number 1 spot and he simply extends that record each and every new tournament. Most people don’t say this part out loud, but he might just be the best TFT player in the world. His macro gameplay often feels flawless. He plays wider than everyone & yet seemingly never misses on board strength evaluation, transitions or core positioning within a given line. When it’s clicking for him, it’s about as close to perfect TFT as you’re going to see. Aside from a super rare day 3 exit at Shurima Cup, his tourney performances have been phenomenal virtually every time out. While we’ve yet to see him win a tourney, he doesn’t have anything left to prove to the people who know he’s the most feared player on the server.

If i was another player at regionals with no plan my strat would to just be try to copy dishsoap line every game for regionals."
Probably not gona stream too much anymore for rest of set 9 AND sweat TFT so i can win regionals and make it to worlds pogo.
@Frodan @Mortdog Fuck it @Mortdog debate panel at tft vegas. Me vs u
@jueliaoh @Kiyoon hi happy bf day yay https://t.co/mDcrS8TGXc
@Mortdog @Frodan MONKAHMMMM have i been playing games wrong this entire time
@scarra pretty sure its the other way around. these val players will soon find out they are too slow and old and can't keep up with the kids and move to tft the official boomer game.
"My TFT study group this set

Pgod - every time i watch him i'm impressed and i'm pretty sure he is the most improved player last 2 sets in a row. 

Soju - every time i watch him lately i'm disappointed in the game play and can't tell if he is trolling cuz i know he is better.

kiyoon - coinflip when talking to him, either he spit facts or what he says is 100% wrong.  

Setsuko - thru the screaming and rage i think he is a wholesome kind boy. 

Phoenix - i don't talk to him much but he plays from the garage."
@abotofu_ ur banned from playing tft

"Newest Comp This patch is Noxus Samira / Cass Reroll but really just Samira.

They buffed - Cass / Samira / Swain

Bis Samira is - Blue buff + Giant Slayer + 1 more dps item

Tank items on Swain ealry game / if u get another blue buff some how it goes on cass 3 otherwise u can just play darius or kat items and play like the old 6 noxus but instead u just have a samira 3 as well. 

Preferably play with a good opener for the comp. 
Can also just tempo a samira + cass + swain opener into anything in the game. 

Will not win out with board need to decide if u roll for kat 3 darius 3 as well or go 9 for legendries."

@setsukotft  - Very Single 

LET ME TELL YA, your entire romance life until this point has been a waste. 
Introducing my boy… Setsuko 
 
Location: Summoner's Rift & your heart 
Ethnicity: Chinese
Height: 5’2
Age: 24
 
Pros:
Athletic AF. is a professional ATHLETE (esports). BUT DW HE WONT PLAY YOU
Low-key famous, he has hordes of (e)girls chasing after him 
The most chill guy I’ve ever met, has a super soothing voice and the cutest laugh
Loves making food and food photography. He can be your instagram bf 
 
Cons:
Can’t get drunk, but will always be down to grab a drink with you   (Will always take care of you though!) UWU
 Has a whack sleep schedule so you’ll never see each other 
“Only” 5’2” BUT THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE MEASUREMENTS, if you know what I mean 
 
Looking for:
Someone to hang with (music, sports, gaming, going out to eat) BONUS if you will play TFT with him  
 Wholesome, kind-hearted, and open-minded
 
BETTER SLIDE INTO HIS DMS QUICK, HE WON’T BE ON THE MARKET FOR LONG! 

Qei'vin ""Setsuko"" Xian (Chinese: 李賢; pinyin: Qǐ'Vin Set'Zuko Xián) (655 BC – 684 BC), was a crown prince of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. He was known for being a Go master, the official board game of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He became ranked 2 Go in 675 after his older sister E'ma Lee Wang, who lovingly refers to him as ""xiao bro"", but soon fell out of favor with the general public due to his public rants and antics and was exiled to ancient Tibet to become a bald monk. His height is 5'2."

1- They Make a new set every 4 months while other devs takes forever. 
2- They actually play the game they work on. ( inikio has 150 games this patch while on his break)

4- Mortdog works like 7 days a week and works 10 jobs at tft. 

Follow for why TFT devs are the worst."
Would you rather date someone who one tricks one comp and doesn't get bored. or a known pivoter.
YOU ARE TELLING ME THERE IS 10 MORE DAYS OF THIS PATCH ? IM DOWN TO BAN MORTDOG FROM GOING ON VACATION WHO ELSE IS DOWN ?

MY THEORY IS THAT THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB BY MORTDOG SO THAT HE CAN'T BE FLAMED IF BALACNING IS BAD. BECAUSE IF AN AUGMENT AVGS TOO GOOD OR TOO BAD PEOPLE WON'T KNOW AND CAN'T FLAME HIM. don't worry to the tft community i shall keep mortdog in check and dm him every day about balancing issues.
@Mortdog wrong balancing it either way has the same effect at the end of the day.
"@CuewarsTaner bro can YOU JUST GIVE ME A STREAMER LIST UPDATED , HOW COME CHINA DOESNT HAVE A MONOPOLY OVER THEIR STREAMERS they just keep changing platforms makes it harder for foreign viewers to find."

Since you pick your legends before the game starts I feel like riot cud have charged $1-$10 dollars for a legend. BUT MORTDOG said since riot canceled NACL riot has too much money left over so everything in TFT is free. https://t.co/60uQ7X8Epz

I Love TFT , but didn't  like set 8 and I just feel like i'm forcing myself to play 8.5. I'm actually really excited for TFT in set 10 + because the problem for me was that first half of the sets didn't matter."

@Kiyoon SET 8 IS KIYOON TIME ? YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE LEFT BUDDY  WOKEGE
I MADE IT TO FUCKING WORLDS
I'M SO HAPPY SOJU FINALLY MADE IT TO WORLDS. HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST UNDERRATED PLAYER IN TFT. AND PGOD IS GOING TO QUALIFY THRU LCQ.
@Mortdog @k3soju Quit your yappin buddy im literally the most optimistic person. Next set will be the best set ever.
"I will put more effort into my streams next set. Means a lot that so many people watch even tho I have no cam / no mic / don't read chat during tourney. BUT PGOD AND SMOJO going to 1/2 it, was fun this week hanging out with them for 14 hours a day talking about TFT."
"That's it for me for set 7 , Honestly I don't even know what my augments even were today.  But that is okay because SET 8 will lit."
@tft_ren @Mortdog
@pockygom THING IS TFT YOU CAN COME BACK ANY TIME JUST WAIT UNTIL U LOVE A SET THATS WHEN U GONA WIN WORLDS.

How come Korea is so good at League of Legends but their TFT players are not very good ? ( No Flame Chatting)
Hey guys I'm pretty sure soju is in peak form for regionals. If you are playing in regionals you should copy his line / contest his starting item / contest his units / contest his item on carousels / scout and position for him / study his vods / he is probably winning regionals.
Probably not going to stream much anymore this set and start prepping for regionals and try to qualify for worlds and go for the underdog story line. Currently don't know how to play the game but I got 1 week to learn.
@Kiyoon @WARDELL416 @jueliaoh GOT ROOM FOR ONE MORE ?
I am going to try to get rid of my TFT accent before it is too late. After studying the top twitch streamers I will only say W and L now.
@robinsongz NO YOU DIDN'T YOU LITERALLY CO STREAMED THE ENTIRE LCQ INTO OVERWATCH

@AesahTFT DONT EVEN SHOW UP TO REGIOANLS IF U WASTED UR LUCK ON DRAGONS CUP
Some people drive to win TFT tourneys  is to prove that they are the best. Mine is to go on the winners interview and talk about the balancing on some of these augments that are not good.

"After playing TFT for over 3 years everyday I think I might like this game, not sure yet tho, will let you guys know in a few years."
People cheating in chess ? For TFT worlds you can just have someone else playing for you or in a call with other people and no one will know. not required to stream or cam or anything.

@BeccaTILTS you forgot TO SIGN UP FOR THE TOURNEY
ALL THESE BLACKPINK SONGS ARE JUST BANGERS.
BLACKPINK ALBUM COMES OUT TODAY. But when will I find someone to go to the concert with.
"Everyone flames the 20/20 one trick players , but shouldn't you find someone who doesn't Scout of Pivot off you?"
Or pivot deadge
There seems to be a misconception going around in TFT that you are allowed to just quit whenever you want to. The unwritten rule of TFT is that you are not allowed to quit until you win Worlds.
"@Rayditzfn ""more than blackpink"" https://t.co/LWiyk8LkTC"
Imagine if TFT had to replay a round every time there was a game breaking bug . . .  i'm starting to think these val players kinda spoiled in terms of bugs
@Kevinramen QUIT YOUR YAPPING I'LL SEE YOU NEXT SET
"Man Sometimes you don't know how good it was until it's gone. 

Yordles &gt; Astrals

@Caaymus wrong group . . .
"The more you complain in TFT the better you will get.
It's about understanding how you low rolled and got mortdogged in every single spot. But just also complain about how much you suck as well at the game and how you can improve."
@gubatft YOU TALKING TO ME ABOUT BLACKPINK ? WHO I WILL MARRY ?
@robinsongz @saralynntft WOKEGE
@gubatft HUH I didn't see this i was too busy looking at how to sign up for presale blackpink concert tickets

Starting to think no one is balancing real life and that lose streaking isn't actually a viable strat.
Just rewatched some of my old Interviews from set 2-6 honestly TFT has had a lot of good memories. I use to be so awkward when I didn't know how to say twitch emotes to express my emotions.
@scarra BRO I THINK UR SCHEDULE IS MISSING SOME TFT
Looking at the 100T stuff the best way to grow is thru DRAMA.  SOOO i just want you guys to know the guy balancing the game ranked me 14th and 16th the last 2 regionals. imagine how he is ranking units/trait strength
"@k3soju @Mortdog Bro you low rolled too hard, that's why you got to to back to balance out the ev, surely you can't go 8th again"

yeah ... i'm pretty sure it's in favor of neither it's in favor of having it to just to have it, while no one trys to improve it"
i lost ... which means  mortdog is forcing me to play 7.5 .... in which i will be complaining to him  about the game so the real low roller of the tourney is mortdog.
@BeccaTILTS @jennitsu_ Bro every ERA IS JISOOS ERA
Made it to Day 2 of Mid Set  9th - 16th pays 150 Dollars so we got that locked up before vegas.

@Mortdog SOMETIMES YOU FAIL AND FAIL AGAIN DOING THE SAME BAD STRAT BUT JUST YOU SEE MORT GUY I WILL WIN ONE OF THESE WORLDS EVENTUALLY
@jueliaoh My boy @Kiyoon got both. He is packing can confirm.
@ChadSmeltz @WSDMGG IF YOU ARE THE NEW ONE DOES THAT MEAN THE LAST ONE QUIT.
@robinsongz lasik was one of the best things i did in my life it is LIT
"Last set 2/4 Ladder players qualified to worlds vs 2/20 ""tourney players"" yet still only 4 spots for ladder. Format promotes soft ladder full year round and as many ""bad"" players into regionals as possible."
"@esportslaw @Frodan @dogdog @WitaCasts Ram Kev Qualified Thru Ladder in Set 5 , and would have in Set 6 if he didn't give up his spot. IDK I just think 4 ladder slots vs 20 Tourney is too big of a gap."
@esportslaw @dogdog @WitaCasts Yeah I'm fine with a lot of slots going to Tourney I just don't think the ratio should be 4 - 20.
"@esportslaw @dogdog @WitaCasts Look at the set 5 ladder line up , Robin was # 6 on points and Spencer was 13.  This is debatably the Highest AVG skill level regionals of all time. https://t.co/CfjTE0g1PL"
AT LEAST SET 7 COMES OUT TOMORROW and set looks pretty well Designed and FUN. https://t.co/EkAFX5UYwX
"@dogdog @WitaCasts IDK china has a 10 spot 1 snapshot format in a 24 man regionals 
Liuli and Liluo went 1/2 at worlds but under the NA format they don't even make it to their regionals. https://t.co/KST3mudBpm"
@WitaCasts @dogdog 345 games for Rank 1 Snapshot isn't that many games throughout an entire set and graph is 40games ~ for last 4 weeks (but it was probably more like 90 games in 9weeks).  To qualify thru the tourney format everyone has to grind like crazy at the start anyways. https://t.co/kKKQFmAx2K
@WitaCasts @dogdog obviously there needs to be tourney slots but it use to be 12 for ladder but they moved it to 4(ladder) / 20(tourney)  and the ladder was just dead for the entire of set 6. Set 6 ladder had just 2 people trying and everyone else was just trolling building their kewkcone and w/e
@dogdog oh you basically have to play that much or more anyways to qualify into the 1st cup.
"SIGNED UP TO MY FIRST GYM MEMBERSHIP EVER TODAY, I will GET JACKED BY THE END OF THE YEAR OR quit after a week cuz set 7 is too lit in which case I will blame mortdog for my irl struggles."

Lost at Worlds twice."
@robinsongz KIYOON LOOKS DEAD
"Spent the last month looking for a new game to play, But in the end the game I wanted to play was right in front of me the entire time, IT'S TFT TIME. SET 7 in 2 days will show why mortdog is the greatest DEV OF ALL TIME."
After playtesting set 7 I believe in the future of TFT because as time goes on League players will get carpal tunnel and wrist problems and be forced to play tft and just chatting viewers will lose their money to slots and play tft for their fix.

Qualifying to Worlds actually makes TFT so much fun for me. Been playing / watching / talking so much lately. Wish there was more than 1 tourney a set.
I don't  get how the TFT monetization team doesn't get more flame. It has been 3 years we are playing a free game and no one wants to buy anything. The TFT team doesn't try to make any money what so ever or sell us anything.
@Kiyoon what have you been doing lately Susge

Going to be Streaming at around 12am - 10 am area for this month to get my Sleep Schedule ready for Tourney I like to repeat the routine everyday for a bit.
@CuewarsTaner Rich get richer 14 gold  windfall 18 gold I don't see the problem here
@Deis1k but set 7 will be the best set of all time
Since Riot always does a really bad job in letting people know when TFT tourneys are I will let you guys know IT'S IN EXACTLY 1 MONTH APRIL 29TH - MAY 1ST 5AM EST.
@BeccaTILTS @msiUSA COOL MOUSE BECCA  !
I DID IT!!! PRIME MINISTER OF DISNEYLAND!! https://t.co/bDXcEzmE25
I some how got lucky enough to get a 2nd chance at worlds. I will try my absolute hardest this year to be as good as I know I can be and prove everyone doubting me wrong. I know a lot of people think I am really bad after watching regionals but I know I can be by far the best.
@Nadeshot TFT is lit peepoShrug.
"@Ramblinnn @ineekoh Bro other regions like eu is playing in it, see you at worlds"
"Thanks to all my TFT friends that I always talk and play with, it's the main reason I get this far and have drive to get better."
This was the Most I ever highrolled in a tourney in my life. Feel like I was playing at 50% of how well i know i can play but all my games today were all just hand fed top 2s highroll. WILL TRY SUPER HARD TO WIN WORLDS THIS YEAR AND LEARN HOW TO PLAY TFT AGAIN and FOCUS. https://t.co/juQMPCEZ1K
WON REGIONALS AND QUALIFED TO WORLDS LETS GO !!!!!!
this might actually be the worst i ever played in a tourney that i tried in but i am high rolling
@Ramblinnn BRO UR GOOD ENOUGH TO QUALIFY THRU THE LAST CHANCE QUALIFER LET ME HAVE THE EASY SLOTS THANKS .
@luquezlol set 10 will be better COPIUM

I AM HIGH ROLLING every game so hard but i just lose to mercs 3 games in a row Madge.
"Hmmm been playing alot of TFT lately and it hasn't clicked at all. This might be the worst patch for me, lose streaking is pretty much impossible and what I love the most is being able to play for 1st every game, but it's mostly an augment diff for 1st."

Will probably only Stream one more time until Regionals no clue how to play tft atm BUT MAYBE IT WILL CLICK.
IF I LOSE REGIONALS I WILL TAKE THAT TIME OFF TO LEARN HOW TO BOIL AN EGG AND SOME OTHER STUFF LIKE DRIVE.
@MismatchedSock0 Bro regionals is in like 10 days no way u prep less than smojo
@BeccaTILTS doesn't look that accurate to me
2 WEEKS UNTIL REGIONALS THAT ENOUGH TIME TO RELEARN HOW TO PLAY TFT HOPEFULLY.
"I think there is nothing Wrong with the Sample Size of Games played. 

The problem is that there is only one tournament that matters. Just have  x4 the amount of ""Worlds"".  Mid / End of a half set.  All these tourneys feel like a waste of time, meaningless, unhyped and unfun."

I don't care too much about the balance of TFT TBH. I just want there to be more than 3 days of the entire set to matter. Most of the tourneys i play in i feel forced to be there and isn't fun. There is no reason to be good at the game besides 1 week every 6 months.

"probably going to be thinking about kiyoon's face as i go to sleep tonight, never seen someone die inside as much as that moment"

The reason why some top tft players act not that smart sometimes is because they want you to think they suck so you don't scout their board as much because you don't see them as a threat don't fall for it grief soju at carousel.

I think TFT's streaming scene could benefit greatly by adding duo queue for Masters+. I don't think it would add more wintraders cause you can already snipe friends very easily. It would help lots of streamers with burnout of the game if they could play with a frenn
@Sajam Down
@ClementKChu at 500lp+ you can easily snipe any player in that elo so if someone wants to win trade with their friend they can already do so. And many people already spam queue into their friends so duo queue already exists in high elo imo. i didnt say to add wintrading it already exists

"@spamofthemic If you verbally admit to intentionally griefing a player, i dont think it matters what placement you go imo. saying ""well I top 4ed"" after posting an apology is defending his play was correct, which is a half apology"

"RT @robinsongz: HERE ARE SOME HEADLINER RULES YOU SHOULD KNOW:

1. If you pass a headliner, the next time you see that champion it will have the other trait. 

For example, if you pass Edgelord Riven, the next Riven will 100% be 8 Bit Riven 

If a unit has 3 traits, it will 50/50 be the other 2 traits. Once you've seen 2 traits. it resets to the other 2 traits.

@Mortdog @Frodan @esportslaw https://t.co/O4Tp65WQj8
If you bug abuse intentionally in TFT you are just self reporting to everyone that you have no confidence in your own ability to be good at the game. Lowkey it's good that this bug exists so we can identify all the idiots in the community when they spam it! keep it up!
