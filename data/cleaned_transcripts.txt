fraud top three i won the game i i don't know why you're saying top three this guy gets fing straight up dumpstered bro the syndra can kill one of my units it doesn't matter it doesn't matter man like wow congrats you killed you killed some shitter congrats i still have morgana like my entire board is is is giga upgraded like i mean yeah i mean congrats i mean you killed one unit yay yay hello @kayn what's going on here you would just copy the file settings and copy paste them to your other client no need to screenshot old man shut the fuck up no one is doing that i knew it i was like how the fuck am i so poor in gold opener like there's just invisible gold on my board what zyra soraka plus one we can play ap flex really easily here i have guinsoo as well sivir two opener i'll lose a gold invest in the uh the opener but i think uh i think ap here is really good you can go zyra soraka plus one it doesn't really matter if it's lilia or syndra they're both good i i mean you can also go kobuko over aatrox it actually doesn't matter maybe he's just good here i got a bf sword though what the fuck this is my last game in practice storied fucking champio this is my last game of practice storied champion really but i think the other options were just not very good okay i mean bt gun blade or sorry bt titans i mean honestly i haven't played it a single time okay five garen 20 gold five garen like it's just so boring like okay why did i take storied champion by the way six warden zyra bro i know how to play it man like it it's it's so brain dead like like like what do you mean bis garen it doesn't matter just three items you have like here it's bow bf titans bt i think it's titans bt steraks but it doesn't fucking matter just three items call it a a titans bt plus one gg if the entire lobby is ap or ad i might just go chain on carousel and just finish the titans but the last item doesn't matter like titans bt is is really good it covers armor mr healing shield it's just whatever you have watch this i go where the trouble is the fuck how is that the strongest one what uh uh bf chain rod is he playing dryad maybe probably wants to try to go tear i don't even know it seems to be a lot more ad than what the fuck i can't really tell though cuz they could actually go no one has actually committed yet everyone's items are just mid unless why is everyone's item so mid where where are this guy's items oh did i kill it i probably killed it this guy i'm guessing he's ad like scoreboard scrapper is probably leaning towards ad i mean i mean this guy can go either like no one has a single fucking item made so i can't even tell i mean then i'll probably just like i just go cloak finish the bt bro is probably half morello duo carry backline this guys mittens probably ad then i mean whatever i'll figure it out later i'm just lost this guys probably ad what did he go for on carousel he's probably playing syndra okay i mean it's it's not that matters anymore i already chose my item i mean zyra is actually kind of good i don't really want to lose econ to hold fuck that unless i want to sell not really um actually wait fuck did i want a five loss i mean this guy's going to open i mean let me let me play this round out honestly the stream i'm it's not even bad um he oh is he playing fated as well and this guy's open if i beat this guy i can uh oh what the fuck oh great uh okay so what happens if i don't find garen because like bro no one cares about jax 3 what the fuck does jax 3 do nothing it's okay i'll hit also like there's no way i don't get a chain the entire game no one wants chain so i have titans rod half morello okay let's i'm pretty sure this augment is broken as fuck is it the best tear two in the game yes it is they just buffed six warden and you just go six warden garen three it it's it's basically lucky paws but garen instead of kobuko it's it's the exact same deal you just duo carry a backline holder like a like a mograna irelia like whatever the fuck with uh with with morello you call it a day and then you just have garen just running like instead of six bruisers you just play six warden and then you just have some backline shitter with morello like like slowly tickling their board yeah fun fun fun fun watch this guys it's gold opener it's gold opener like you have to hit it's gold opener come on another rod the fuck like am i am i really going for for this shitter three okay this game's over oh i got a chain the fuck deal i mean rod like like okay how is is archangel even that bad i mean it's it's morello like i'm not going fucking rabadon but like is it even that bad let me just look at the stats like i mean lowkey might be crownguard hold on get three three star what is this storied champion storied champion what is this titan blood thirster garen garen items i'll even go sample size of 10 i can recombob it uh craftable oh what the fuck i mean this is like fake news though like i go double titan steraks like i kind of want to save the morello archangel 3.7 where's crownguard oh that's shit like fuck it i just make rabadons fuck it and i just streak like i i don't really want to go archangel and then like i mean half morello is so easy to get like i mean it's not even bad i mean not fucking recombob all right lunch money i go straight to nine fuck it keepers one lunch money all right whatever fuck it also should i just go should i go blue oh okay all right rabadons wait shred doesn't it do true damage i mean i have lunch money i'm just going to play streak wait what i mean it's fine i bro i literally looked at the stats i mean i mean the reason it's good is because you just get rid of the rods i don't have belt bf component like who the fuck cares like the comp is not like garen 3 is going to fall off like crazy but the reason it's good is cuz it doesn't fall off until later and then you just and then you just run them down go nine cap around like fucking full legendary who cares if garen 3 fell off it's going to fall off regardless of items and then oh what's this six warden irelia 2 game's over gg hello these ghostly procs are just completely dumpstering me what's going on over here but if i lose a single one of these rounds that i'm not supposed to like you can't tell me this is not a rabadons diff no you're telling me you're losing your five streak for free yeah didn't think so and then half steraks is not even good cuz that's half morello anyway hopefully i can nine on 5, 5-1 i mean probably have lunch money like 9 on 5-1 and then i can just cap around irelia gallo okay what w am i even missing uh illaoi nautilus y so why like why did i take storied champion again you know what i learned from this game nothing this is my warm-up game also i could have made econ i could have just sold jax oops two component anvils i mean that's pretty good morello morello what happened to my sivir and morello ah shit okay well i don't really want to pop the other one i'm too scared but like what if i lose my streak cuz i don't make sunfire but i mean no one's making a fucking sunfire cape like i can go infinite tgs like there's no way i lose yeah like i'm just going to go glove and pop the other one after post like you can't lose it's not possible also what's the ink toxin no fuck is this guy four duelist fuck like like can't this actually kill my team cuz it can eat two procs oh oh okay oh galio actually taunted it off but oh it's fine oh okay okay oh okay i mean like if it's someone l lose to it's qiyana 2 with ga cuz that shit is so much damage okay belt glove i mean if i have lunch money i'm kind of down to just roll for six warden aatrox over sylas its not better sylas is way way stronger unit than the stupid ass aatrox tear glove tg two gnar two don't want to roll anymore like am i just greeding the fucking i mean i can i can go redemption which is actually pretty good and then i can just go bow which is half red buff and then i just go tg redemption belt tear tg and then this is half red buff okay i refuse to go sunfire like morello and and red buff like can actually be built on irelia and i'm nautilus off of uh six warden but like my board's too stable gifts is pretty good wellfed big grab bag gifts irelia okay okay okay illaoi two no diff illaoi two no diff oh oh i get lunch money oh yeah oh you're right you're right oh you're right you're right kayle ap oh no i just want to put the i want to put the redemption next to the garen is is all okay well i hope i get a bow or i just have no duo carry again no antiheal no duo carry this game is fucking terrible okay and then i just 9 on 5-1 i dunno rabadons is it's probably not bis but like it makes sense to make it this game like this rabadons's like i would have lost my streak on stage three i'd be like let's say like 60 hp like greedin true bis like who the fuck cares about bis am i going to lose the game with irelia 2 six warden sett two irelia 2 everything two probably not and i mean if i do lose like who cares it's still a second that's pretty good reading chat during a tourney smh cheater bro i like it's a fucking it's a okay also this is not even a tourney game this is a solo queue game but also it's not even an advantage to read man there's so many idiots like sometimes i watch the vod and like some of these suggestions that people make like like i'm not even reading chat and they're just yapping away and i'm just reading this shit like after and i'm just mind blown it's it's just it's actually disrespectful that like they're they're even allowed to type it's disrespectful that they're even allowed to type all right where the fuck is the nautilus i saw like that guy had three four five six seven seven oh man oh wait oh bet yay oh okay i mean is it even better than this it it gives porcelain to my redemption is that bad yay porcelain to redemption like arcanist porcelain i mean like storyweaver gives 20 ap but doesn't arcanist also give 20 ap yes oh fuck i just dumpstered a fucking syndra 2 three item all right byebye the the one turn i needed to spike i spiked cuz i like i would have lost to this guy for sure with four warden okay yay yay okay uh what do i play now qiyana qiyana wukong zyra oh okay works for me what happened to my zyra i didn't i didn't hold on to the zyra it's okay it doesn't matter you like it's not like storyweaver actually does anything like i mean sage is nice though and then duelist for the irelia is pretty nice as well but at the end of the day it doesn't really fucking matter like i'm not rolling a single time on nine i'm just going straight to fucking 10 and you just cap on 10 irelia two star the stuff two star and the stuff and gg's like you can probably even cap around like sivir xayaj sivir xayah lee sin xayah 2 lee sin 2 i mean not even sivir like kaisa 2 i mean i don't really need toxin like jax over gnar like jax udyr kaisa xayah it doesn't matter what you actually cap around who the fuck cares oh zyra oh qiyana uh encounter qiyana yay what is this i can go tg tg yay okay now what oops i forgot to put in a unit i me i can play zyra i can play qiyana i mean it gives me whatever qiyana it is who cares amumu and i just cap around three item irelia on 6-1 level to nine zyra not upgrading this trash amumu maybe i remake kaisa cuz i can cap on kaisa 2 xayah 2 as well with jax udyr what the wait i fought clone so i don't get gold oh my fucking god like what like lunch money on this stage like like what where you can cover on soraka rakan 2 to it's just six warden six warden irelia lee sin or qiyana plus two it it like bro like the the comp plays itself man like this okay this cannot be my last game like this is the worst why did i choose this qiyana wukong zyra i mean do i mean do you see do you see wukong no but like let's say i hit rakan 2 like oh yeah like let's let's just not make rakan 2 i have to play sage i have to play sage for for one fucking unit no you fucking don't you just you just upgrade to like i mean xayah 2 is xayah 2 rakan 2 like it like it it like it doesn't matter like who cares oh no i think i lost actually i think it's it's actually kind of close i think it's l one i think i won oh right yess uh i should probably deny three stars like maybe he's going morg 3 i mean these matchups i kind of want to go corner but also this guy i think i actually lose because i don't think i can drain tank his team but here like sunfire's middle he's probably going to move right but i can't go oh okay oh this guy's scoreboard scrapper he's actually strong as fuck is he still at the bottom oh he is wait someone needs to kill him off soon or he's going to actually win out he's been scoreboard scrapping the entire game oh no oh wait and bye-bye all right good duelist plus one i mean there's umbral like one star umbral i just go gs unless runaans is better umbra two umbral is not actually good you you just do more damage if you just yeah all right well hopefully that doesn't get hit hit eight or i'm or maybe i'm i'm just dead as fuck the stats say runaans is better but i don't know if it's actually better maybe it is i don't fucking know uh amumu lux soraka he's eight duelist they just gave him eight duelist for free like come on titans bt mittens lee sin like okay it's fine i'll probably have enough damage it's not a big deal soraka zyra damn there really isn't a warden on here huh this game fucking sucks i'm not i'm not just going to play syndra and soraka like i i don't have to play zyra either i don't play zyra or soraka but i think there's a warden on here i probably actually play zyra soraka warden it's kind of unlucky oh this gunblade's kind of nice oh i think it's dead anyway it is oh man i think i lost i lost for sure aw man bro no one's upgrading alright he sold just going zyra 2 oh no one's going for three stars yeah bro this is not even fucking worth it this like this shit's not even worth it like or like like i mean maybe i buff the backline eventually but like this shit is like this is pissing me off give me a sec oh wait oh db i mean i can also go guinsoo like guinsoo or db actually in this match up i'd rather just go db what about this match up i already have red buff and gs i mean even if i lose to him now it's fine my board died instantly i'm worried that even if i have like everything two starred i might actually lose this actually probably not i don't believe it is is is dropping double sett even stronger cuz i could play i could play wukong qiyana rakan or i can also go like lee sin two but lee sin two has no items so i don't even mind sage also this unit is just dying instantly man to to what is double irelia strongeri don't even know if if this zyra wukong is even stronger than like is it not like is isn't it just sett two irelia 2 yes why the fuck am i playing qiyana zyra on my board i mean sage i feel like sage is not actually like i mean i guess it's okay sett decent stacks okay but also like bro this irelia is just is kind of a fraud it has been getting tickled down by this lilia and morgana every single fight this is the fucking worst oh don't corner okay let me put this over here then like i could drop these two for these two but i don't even mind the corner bait oh fuck i oh oh fuck

you are so washed you are so washed bro robin like why the is zillian talking to
me like i it's just so like unreasonable man
ah um wait does anyone know where i can
find it
on the official spreadsheet
uh uh uh check-in starts in 19 hours at 2
p.m. check-in ends at 3 game start at 4: checkin channel thread recent
spreadsheets
wait are they actually out star star
star star star
star my last time being no no no i don't i can't see it i just see star star or
like where where do i see
it star okay never mind all right let me just lock in one time like this is just
like i'm tired of of going eif every game like let me just lock in it's over
gg's but if i lock in it might be too
boring and i just win for free like this game i mean this game i
just high roll also why am i why do i even hold garen here like what does holding garen do for
me here nothing also why do i even have tahm kench on my board bro like like it's not
even good like i didn't even buy the aatrox man it's
lucky paws but i don't have a single kobuko but i have belt tear rod cloak like should i just force it but like bro if
you don't hit you just go fucking eighth straight up
eighth
i mean you can't miss agreed and also like the thing is i'm
four out of six or or sorry oh yeah i'm four out of six of uh of trist kobuko dclaw spark
redemption and then like chances are this kobuko can actually farm me some gold
bro i got chaos by the the fucking one and bye-bye i me it doesn't matter
like you don't have to kill with the ability you just get a gold and
bye-bye what
i mean it's not balanced but the thing is it's balanced if you miss like if if you if you can hit
kobuko 3 with even 20 gold remaining on 3-1 you instantly win the game but the problem is is if you don't hit you go
instant
eighth
yeah and i'm not trying to go instant eif no bt it's not that good because a lot of the healing is uh he he's going to
have a lot of hp so uh i mean spark is he does infinite magic damage and then and then redemption is is uh it heals
based off max hp and then dclaw also heals off of max hp so it's like you just want it's redemption dclaw plus one
for sure you can even you can even go sunfire if you want it doesn't even fucking matter but like the titans bt shit is just gigawis

i got ksed by the fucking
aatrox uh i mean i can if i if i buy tk here i have to win the round and and this guy has to farm me too
yeah he will gg's he has anti-heal but honestly i
think he will he just has to kill two units which is pretty easy and i don't really want
to lose my three streak for no reason like even if i don't make econ if this if this is the difference of me winning the round it's already worth
like just wait like like if if i if i actually hit here yeah gg's hello six kobuko please
oh bet five out of six true bis
dclaw all right so what are the kobukos
encounter
uh i don't really want to send it though oh i don't think i can kill
this i don't have anti-heal aw man i didn't kill a single
unit that's okay making 40 gold it's all good
come on come come pleasee innervating innervating innervating oh
actually wait i'm pretty sure talisman's also
broken wait were the stats on talsman broken they were
yes fuck i don't remember no it is it is it is it it is it is it's like fuck it true bis i already won the game all right
bet gg no they uh they buff trench coat is
like trench coat it's like whatever now but i'm pretty sure like i think
innervating locket it might be better oh wait oh i have riven oh sorry
oops i'm not sure though
i still lost this is actually probably a riven diff
though like it is a riven diff i could have won this fight fuck
hello hello does anyone know where the kobukos
are
at i already rolled like four times oh it even works on neutrals the
fuck
bro it's probably not even worth making these i'm not going to lie one roll and
gg's okay okay i mean i don't want to break i
don't want to go zero also raw chain i mean do i ever just go riven three just roll riven as well fuck it
i'm not re roll aatrox cuz he still needs he still needs to get some gold but i mean i'm at five
but you know what i have a true bis item like maybe it's fine like maybe kobuko can actually just solo carry with the trist also it's radiant item by the way
so i have a remover and i can remover the spark onto someone else i remover the spark on someone else and then i go
dclaw redemption whatever the fuck this item is called and they can't play the game
i didn't hit combat caster
epoch i mean it's not this not tons of stats like should i just take epoch for three free rolls i mean i'm still level
five it's fine okay
one two three oh nice okay
that's pretty good cuz the thing is like after you hit kobuko 3 the the carry of the comp is is
what's his
name the carry of the comp is is is is irelia you just go
anti-heal irelia and they can't play the game you just you just have this kobuko tank 10 million years
and then you just have sylas irelia just run them
over i found more kobukos on five than than
four bro this talisman
fuck i should have sold i should have sold for 50 fuck my bad oh wait
what and one roll yeah gg's i might as well roll to 40 okay gg's i
see um all right move crownguard
i like the thing is the ap scaling is like fake and i i kind of just want per up time on spark


bro it looks so troll
12k hp
yeah yeah if he gets dclaw it's fucking over dclaw
redemption but also i need anti-heal like i i i need like you need a duo carry of the irelia because like later
later on it's going to go ot it doesn't matter how much
hp this this piece of shit doesn't even need spark he's about he's about to they could have triple dclaw it'll just get
straight up one shot okay


oh know the uh the problem with uh with with like like just trust like this kobuko has no ap scaling all the damage
comes from the hp cuz it does deals if blah blah blah uh deals oh and then it
scales off of hp so that's why it's it's so fun
bro it actually can't be right
oh this is actually not good for me like hp doesn't really do anything uh i mean my board i mean hp
like on bruiser i mean let me see what the ap scaling is cuz it's good on it's not
good on irelia either but it's not
ad but i mean i'm not going ad i'm just going like bro this is not even good it's actually bad because it it helps
everyone else it doesn't actually help my board at all what the fuck does this do for me
nothing 150 hp yay like if you if you look at bulk on bruiser it doesn't do
anything because bruisers already have hp you just want like for example like would you
take bulk three or would you take fucking tiny but deadly you just want to fuck actually deal like like you want
your team to do something it's like guys it's not actually good like it my board like can't scale with like i mean i
don't want to go cuz there's only 180 unit it's going to be irelia later and then
like like a fight's not going to be a fucking 100 hp on a piece of shit that already had 10k hp diff you know what i
mean oh i got ks all right it's radiant item
here uh i can go radiant sunfire uh i mean radiant dclaw is not that good
or or sorry bt like it's not good it's it's not bt like bro like dclaw is more healing actually at the same time like
it's actually pretty good and that redemption someone else no you know
on a sylas i might as use by free rolls
on on this level and one and two i have three free rolls the
fuck and four

oops
like bulk bro guys it's like bulk is not good it's not good it's not good r
oh oh honestly radiant refractor is also not good i mean it's pretty good but it's
not that good i mean it's
fun i can go radiant like what which one's even better does anyone
know oh it's dclaw it's dclaw

dclaw i kind of want to play i play towards irelia
yeah i already have a i already have radiant the thingy uh radiant
sunfire but you need you need irelia to kill the trash because like look at look at his backline he's allowed to just sit there and do
that 18 18k
hp bro it looks fucking bugged oh wait i think he's
dead he's getting perma shit on he can't
move like it's not actually good i mean i no it is good like i mean like like i get irelia here the game's over all i got some garbage to to
kill the
trash i have a illaoi on my board qiyana
yorick i mean i don't really want to roll though oh whatever
sure i'm going to be level 10 on
5-1 or not level 10 but i'm i'm probably going to be level 9 5-1 and then i just cap around
it doesn't matter fuck
b man i like i i'm kind of down to play some arena but like you can't even end on this game like is it oh wait i'm
picking what the fuck do i even want okay i probably wanted that no i want oh i need a rod is there a rod oh
fuck did i miss oh who got the rod did i miss

rod i can play yorick as well
i just realized i don't have a galio the fuck
it only it only healed 3.4 but that's cuz i mean yeah but i will finish
them who else is going to use the db honestly i'll just just blue this it's
not even that bad whatever actually i guess i can go not hold

bag gain two lesser chimp dupes and six gold is there an encounter no
h maybe it's a mal fight
roll alone
and gg i mean i'm kind of down to play a kha'zix roll
game like i just sacked the
stage i i don't really care about the qiyana that much but that just make 10 i mean i'm pretty sure it's actually
good let me make sure there's no other divine divine whatever the that way there isn't all right like what items would i
go though like with
these bt last wher econ i'm down i'm pretty sure g is like like
you need it it's probably i mean the stats is probably pretty
good divine rolls is so many roles
wait g is like giga plus delta all right no ga it like bt last plus
one i feel like do you just want to one shot their carry or
something
clear and honestly it's probably not going to be like kha'zix's only like you probably actually do car other stuff cuz
all you going for mali 3 kha'zix 3 qiyana 3 i could also just go
for nah i feel like divine rolls it's it's kind of
good like i can just roll like how many is it like stage two or stage three you gain four free rs
plus one at the start including this one gain four free r rolls plus one for
each of your heavenly so i get eight rolls i get 16 gold worth of value like i can even go nico 3 doo
carry kha'zix 3 n 3 mali 3 qiyana
3 you can't miss
no you can play two of the same unit to get more r yeah but i only have four unit
slots so i already have
for s is looking good and sey offline all day bro he just woke up man he he said how's it going buddy
roll kindred too i i'll probably hold on to it i nah i probably wouldn't upgrade it cuz i i i think the other three stars
are going to be like it's a lot easier to three star mal fight cuz it's cheaper like mal fight kha'zix and yeah cuz it's
just cheap but you also want to just push levels cuz you can you can start playing towards like the better
units like i'm not trying to load in with uh like three k level
six i'd rather just have three star mal fight three star kha'zix and then you just push levels
cuz the thing is you have so many free rolls that you're you're basically guaranteed to hit like mali kha'zix eventually like even even if you don't
have malite 2 kha'zix 2 like after the free rolls like let's say i have like six six kha'zix are you really going to
stay level five and slow roll for kha'zix 3 or you can just push levels and you get another 10 free
rolls on on 41 and then you'll hit kha'zix 3 guaranteed like i mean it's not even bad
but like and you i mean you have to you
have to
yeah like i mean you have to you have to push levels you can't you can't just stay level six the whole entire game for kha'zix 3 and hope the kha'zix
carries cuz you still need the other trash units especially wukong i it's not even a loss
maybe i roll
yon you
i want one round this stage and i just griefed my my five loss it's fine i expect to start winning rounds after
this if k jes to the left i'm i dead oh i didn't think
change i ro you
like don't wor i'll i'll i'll hit k 3 like don't worry i'm getting another like 30,000 rolls
says i'm i'm going to win this round
anyway i mean i have bow for half red
buff i mean how good is blistering strikes here is it even
good i'm kind of down for healing cuz this idiot just jumps in like a idiot he's almost
always but healing one doesn't i don't want this oh har this one is better oh band of
these i mean har this one is way too
good uh i mean do i want to stay level five though
i go red buff on
carousel i'm going to lose this for sure but it's
fine all right what what are the six odds on or what are the one cost odds on six does anyone
know hello
30 33
30 cuz i still want kha'zix 3
but next two c i mean seven gold seven gold oh
bet all right how about i slow roll on seven until one caus here or or five and then i push six yeah cuz the thing is i
can still upgrade i can still upgrade qiyana as well it's not even bad to roll
okay okay i'm pushing y
i could have played uh i could have played
yor and then uh i just wait until neutrals and i'm probably just i'm i'm probably guaranteed to hit yeah and then
hopefully i can be level eight by 51 and then i'm basically guaranteed to hit kayn 2 as well oh wait this might
be a first
i mean i feel like divine rolls is just op as
i didn't kill a single unit bow
tear all right red buff morgana
okay why red buff not morello i mean i mean i don't have a morello but also a morello is
better on on units that are are like an heal bots or sorry red buff is better on units that are anti-al bots cuz red buff
is more attack speed and it's also better on units that already have like ap cuz it's more attack
speed like on syndra like the stats 100% will say red buff is better like on h red buff is is going to it's probably
better than m i i don't know about way but i know for sure
syndra it's better to uh to have red buff if you do end up red
buffing i mean there's not wrong with r buff on syndra like it's basically a natur's tooth without the
ap i will not hold back all right and after this round is
my last loss i'm using all my rolls kha'zix 3 and i can probably still go eight on
42 so 42 will be my last loss cuz i really need i really need to start getting like the kayn morgana diana like
the sage in and like the duo carries in you you can't just loaded with with like
yeah but i i'm pretty sure i have to roll until kha'zix 3 because it's my
item holder yeah go seven no i mean i need kic three
or i'm eigh so i'd rather just roll on six and then eight on 42 if possible i
mean i actually have the econ for it like leveling gives me one roll but i
much rather roll on six odds it's not a loss it's
fine unless i want to just go eight and just roll for kayn and just
ditch this kha'zix nah
infinite gold rod tear
you you
for mona w
uh i mean it's fine this my last loss one
more i thought i was about to not hit kha'zix 3 and then i'd just be eighth oh he's kind of a
beast yo good job kha'zix
and i still have the econ to 4 to oh actually reaper plus one for
sure oh do you think i can sell this in time i'm not trying to run above this
dude oh bet
forget the past it only clouds the future forget the past it only clouds
the
future some call me evil shall i prove them right

is make me stronger
the thing is i'm actually on pace to nine i can nine on 62 if i don't roll a single time starting
now also i kind of want more front line than i i should have just sold this kindred i i shouldn't have even made the
kindred is what i shouldn't have done like what the is this why do i make kindred i don't
know i mean i i guess like k like diud doesn't really matter or or sorry n9 on five2

but it's like it's like weird cuz i'm going to be using all my rolls on eight and then i'm leveling to nine on five too like that doesn't sound
right but i mean what like what i supp to
do there's a cane with the worthless ass chain is that even worth it it's cane
pared it has a worthless ass chain on it though no i'm going nine i don't care
that this is a straight to
nine and then at nine i can fit wukong wukong over diana and i can play like plus one y 2 is y
2 i didn't even scout how many moras are gone rock on one off mal fight
okay i wait okay sorry i why the why am i going for qiyana
3 it's a real question also like was my k doing something no 1k front line is front
line oh no it's good but like i can go nine on like with this i can go 9 on 51 actually no i can't cuz i i have to buy
the units i might just roll an eight and then nine on five too how many units am i killing
here okay i cannot take another bad loss or i can't even nine on 52 like what the
is this hello he's one oh oh no he's not oh okay
i mean do i have enough to nine no cuz the thing is i need at least 20 gold because i need to buy the units what the

all right hopefully i can beat this guy i mean i don't even think he's a
duelist if i win this i win the game this game's over

i could have bought the qiyana oops you could get an extra roll i i can't even level to
roll i mean i could level to roll but i need eight gold for morgana eight gold for kayn i also need to buy wukong i
have to buy yon too yeah i'm down to just roll eight
it's fine
unless i get like 20 gold
here i'm coming for you
i am lost call me evil shall i prove them sorry i am
lost oh
bet i didn't buy this soraka though
i kind of need some two stars like now this guy is everything like okay i think i'm going
eighth i mean i'm going nine to roll once like why don't i just roll on eight

all right i'm i mean i'm down to i'm down to just sack i don't care i'm not rolling if i if i lose this round i'm
still two lives no matter what i'm going nine to roll cuz i can i can play 6 heavly at nine but i don't i don't want to roll
like i don't want to roll this turn like i don't i don't think i actually have enough money to roll or to hit but i also like i'd be surprised if i lose no
17 two liv 17 two lives like don't worry like i'm i'm about to win out don't worry don't worry
coming but there's there's no way 17 is one life when when you you have like these that just like try to one
like one shot one unit you know what i mean i i don't believe
it also like silus 2 is is probably actually
better crit every time so lucky it's a 95% crit chance man
no i s one i s one don't worry i'm too l i'm too l don't worry there's there's no way 17 is not two lives like it's not
possible stupid ass kha'zix you
what you
me and watch this heavenly plus one on carousel
and now i have enough econ to go 9 seven heavenly bro the game's over wukong 2 yon 2 kayn
2 so lucky i mean bro you guys are sitting here why aren you rolling 17 hp why aren't you rolling i mean i'm i'm
winning out is what i'm doing the game's over gg
in we are made by our choices this
is coming for
you myour only
beginning is this my only non- heavenly unit
yeah i'm so surprised i didn't even hit y 2 here like what the but mean this game's
over it was kayn it's not kayn it's never heavenly cane it's not it it doesn't do anything man oh no it does
do something but i'd rather have these three items it's not even close
gu some call me evil shall i prove them right
oh what the alune 3 annie 2 lilia 2 mythic plus
one this stupid ass kx just jumped in oh it's all good as long it doesn't one
shot my my cane oh bet bye-bye
just stu
only the future why am i not going tender rolling hello what the is this i'm just sitting here rolling on
our choices the plan no one said no one told
me it was pot of gold get back
strong coming power of
aagon also i just realized isn't rakan just better than lein there's no way i'm putting items on this piece of also
hello they're going for three stars i wasn't even looking evil shall i prove them right oh
i will not hold
back reve our way can i get the rock on back please
away
i will not
s to the plan have
a oh bet it's all good it's another first


i don't get it this one's too hard i give up fruit dirty text batter can low
message picture
skull oh bet i'm back
the is pong i think i already did these three and then it it didn't say one one one
away so i'm pretty sure it's not baseball garden fruit like dirty
vile skull low cann batter like
batter batter fruit pitcher like you're bacon
can low pong skull vial dirty
base like a base sure whatever it
okay i don't even know what i like a base okay
garden fruit fruit
can low base like bottom of the like like garden
tablecloth vial skull pong pitcher dirty can i don't get
it can pitcher like it hold stuff is that even
a thing like tablecloth holds a table like like table stuff a
can i don't get
it low pong skull i give up i i've given up
this i just want to see what they are
corrupt base what
base classic still life components
still p
fruit beer batter i mean that's fine beer can beer
garden what oh okay i feel like today was kind of bf what the is
this like beer like i like i mean beer beer can beer batter and then beer pong that's fine but garden's like whatever
but then like usually it's only the purple one that has the like it's usually only the
purple one that has the bf but like i feel
like like base how i didn't even base corrupt like
low like dirty vile and then still light
fruit
sc such
creatures whoever today's connections just get fired no disrespect
though watch
this also can someone explain to me i'm not even going to say it it's all
good
yay
this this even that
bad you today
also how come this doesn't proc immediately you have to wait like time first

also i just realized why why did i even level here my board sucks regardless like until i upgrade this
to like doesn't my board just suck yes so why the did i even level here am i trolling i think i just
i just leveled to
grief yeah wait what what am i even
doing also i'm i'm i'm pretty sure i just go rod here on
carousel it's fine i'm still making
t i mean i think i'm playing syndra again but like i can also play
towards i can also play towards snipers so i don't really want to pop
yet let me see what the encounter is and then i'll probably decide
i mean i can still play either or but i mean this guy's snipers this guy's
probably playing like some ap flex garbage mana mazay is he just kaisa
kaisa kaisa probably i this guy's probably syndra diamond hands last
whisper he's probably snipers it's probably like some ad thing and
then this guy's ashe as well okay so i'd rather just play toward syndra
yeah i mean i'm kind of down to level here i feel like my board is actually
like one upgrade away from being kind of good i didn't kill a single unit
like do i do i mean tear like it doesn't have to be tear like is it is it belt or is it tear the thing it's probably belt
cuz the thing is i can i can still go like i can use another belt another belt is easily sunfire another belt was
easily natural like i can actually use like six
belts okay and then this is half like blue buff shogun half sunfire like gargoyle like whatever the and then
half jg i mean it has to be jg but the problem is i need two rods so i mean this is probably i mean i
don't know what the i mean i can go steadfast hard if i were five streaking i probably
would sl set f heart here i think i'm five lossing
here i didn't kill a single unit guys i have another
question oh what the wait is this broken i didn't even know it was oh what the this is kind of
good okay but still like how is this not nerfed moon moonstone whatever the
i mean if i if i win i win it's fine like i prefer to
lose there an aos what the i i i didn't kill a
how many dryad saacks do i have
one cost bf wait what please make me a pretzel and make some cheese i can't
h we
too no one is promised tomorrow
i mean i can go sunfire shiv and that way i don't have to worry
about spark and honestly shiv might actually be better cuz i have i have eternal whatever the
or nah but then if i go ship then like where the are my c items that
yeah n that and then i just slam this cuz like no matter what like like i'm not making jg first i'm making spark first and then i just have nash's tear
plus spark if i get a
rod oh nice oh this is good
one unit lost who the cares gargantuan best friends i honestly
isn't best friends kind of good in this lobby guinsoo iie the this death whatever
the last whisper this guy's ap ap ap ad i mean it's pretty good i'll allow it out of here out of here too
healthy in this lobby nah or like in this comp nah i best friend's pretty
good i okay it's fine it doesn't matter like
the thing is like wouldn't you rather lose yes no i mean probably not but like i mean yes assuming i i lose
this round by one by one unit but if i win this round then i'd rather just
win i want to see everything
bro i need some dryad stacks i'm at four that's not even bad
also i i should have just itemized this ar instead of this k but i didn't even know i i didn't even know i had already
to it's fine 54 how many stacks
six i'm trolling like why why am i itemizing this kindred when i could to be itemizing the um oh my

godone also should i just go shiv like bro okay just not two star two
cost not like three cost not irelia like can i just get like a clean carousel not some
garbage yes clean carousel no
garbage acceptable
oh bet an ore oh well that
good half spark the glove is kind of useless cuz now i i still need two rods again but i mean i like
whatever an orange an orange like i'll take it that's pretty good
yay bro like i'm i might just go a random ass re3 it's not even
bad uh i don't really want to make adapted first because i need the
thingy i need spark
al to honestly i'm surprised he's still level six also this game i'm probably
just sending it on 41 level 750 here
was that at 11 how do how am i still at how
it i thought i killed
three i'm coming for you i herald the greatest
oh oh oh oh i oh this positioning is not right
oh i'm sorry
okay i mean you you know me losing this round actually would like got me so much gold i'm up like 15 gold i can 41 it
guaranteed like 28 hp it doesn't matter like i'm i'm rolling like infinite gold first you can't miss

get what what the are these components i will not hold
back wow okay i will not this game is trash i mean
i'm still going to roll but like this game is
trash it's just okay i'm done i can't play this game anymore this game is terrible

i mean i'll probably just dry out this
then what okay it's fine it's
fine like how is this come on man like really like really this game is all
luck like how can l no no it's
gg's i mean d plus one and fated plus one is it even
good it's not like my level 9 is so
bad i mean it gives me kindred 2 as well and like i i mean i mean i don't really want this i'll take it it's
fine let's move i've
got i'd rather tg front line yeah
i don't really want to
roll i need a spark uh i don't know i feel like f plus
one and dr plus one is not that good the
but at the same time like it's not bad
br no matter what i can kn on 5 51 probably
this guy oh unified little buddies you know i don't have spark i think i'm
eighth never mind i mean i have or 2 synr
2 i mean if i can make it to level 10 i can play seven fated six
dryad
y but i'll probably just play i'll probably just play six dryad six fated or
oh yeah six fated i mean there's nothing wrong with that like i mean fated aer it's a free aer item
y your 28 health talking about level 10 for what bro look at my board i have
syndra 2 or 2 three item three item like i i what are you what are you talking about like you think i'm losing
a single round it's not even possible i mean just look

this has morello to lilia too it's all good bye-bye holy wa this is kind of
close oh okay i think i lost hello okay i'm still too lives it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter i'm still too lives i'm roll the out on nine never mind one off of already three the
i mean i could roll here for like for like one it's it's fine no matter what i'm n next turn like nah i'm not
rolling for i drop this trash like no matter what i'm playing toward six dryad and if i don't hit a zero i'll
just play seven
also i don't like this positioning i need i need i want to move gnar up this positioning sucks
i mean 17's guaranteed two lives on stage on stage five some still two lives which is really
good by the way i'm kind of down to this level here like this position anymore
am i autom out of items i am oh my
god such potential
i don't really want to roll i think this board's actually stable for this stage but if i'm one life i'll obviously i'll
roll but i'm pretty sure i can try to go nine seven fated six
rad or i'm down to play like one turn of
way and then maybe i can i can print this already so maybe i should roll nah i'm going to roll never
mind and i can just maintain two lives
i just rolled man i mean it's fine i didn't lose that
much gold i lost like some like i mean i lost a good amount of shops like a lot of shops like this
game i alone my we are made by our choices
without the thing is this is so much weaker
whatever who cares i will not also the entire lob is probably going for three
star for
cost oh yeah i should probably fade it his ear i'm probably going to sell his ass or i'm going to sell this way anyway
don't worry i i could play fated or as well if
i found another
one oh wait oh i can fit wait can i
fit i'm pretty sure i need to be able to
i'm pretty sure i need to i have to be able to fade it the or though
no
yes oh wait no i can fated the rex eye also like it i'm greeding one
like who cares
i don't care i'm i'm hatching this i'm hatching this uh this rex side it's it's not even bad it six dry
added oh wait oh so oh sorry sorry i'm
sorry bro it doesn't matter the game's already over


i i'm not to just hold just to pressure him to to go for to to like to roll and hold
syndra but if he doesn't if he doesn't want to roll then i'll just
roll and then if he rolls for cinder i'll just go 10
the
good i mean it's also it's all it's also only one goal to
roll so i'm kind of down to just roll it's so
cheap a also is he going for anything
this is
freedom i i just sorry sorry i'm sorry i forgot i forgot i was even going for this piece of
wouldn't wish my onbody
am i
dead well i think i killed enough okay it's
fine i will not hold back it's not even worth it
such power okay syndra 3 like you ahri ahri syndra
3 syndra syra's syndra set
pair yeah i can't die
surely it's bugged wait what do you mean it's
bugged wait what wait what's bugged i mean i mean i i
feel like i can't die like i i think he's playing a bunch of like aoe
it healed 1.3 that's it no prison
it only gets 15% i mean it i mean it only healed 1500
last round or 1300 and it has 6.5k hp like that i'm just going to one shot on
faster
okay i mean this positioning was just terrible i need to just put a melee unit on the bottom left so i don't get no
assaulted no i mean it's not on my side like what
am i supposed to do man i mean my bad i
guess no pron can hold
i mean i just have to put a melee unit on that side so i don't get na listed

so how come this guy still in the
game we are made by our choices
the greatest blessing f is
our wait he's going oh
oh bet
wait did i lock oh oops i mean it's fine i mean he's probably going to go for for some three star legendary so i
just i mean he gave up on this one
hello for no hello

all right bet gg i don't even know why when morello i have
this thingy
are you having


oh that's not good oh help help
help i didn't h a single ability
bro i didn't h it okay it's all good honestly you know what it vendor sentinels like there's no way i get
spiked
f like if i get spiked i might just end stream it's all good
spite gem
oh i got double i you know you know they they they said that you can't you
can't roll double and you know if you get double zezy rod one of the ezy rods just don't
spawn you you just have have one that's it
oh get in tou with your
spiritual maybe i'll play some syndra bro syndra's kind of relaxing you literally just turn off your brain and
let's say you go eighth most of the time when you go eighth the comp is so linear that you can't even you can't even
misplay man like you i mean if you didn't hit syn you didn't hit or you didn't hit the on your roll down i
mean all right
great get in with your while i think there are fad that need to happen i will die in the hill that syndra is fine she's
basically unchanging this launch and is in argonus she is not the
problem i mean i i honestly i kind of agree with you because i actually think syndra was good for a while like i mean i
and i mean i think i think i think it might have actually just been some problem like with it okay it's not it's not even the problem it's it's more so i
i think the set just doesn't have that much single target
no like isn't that isn't that actually the bigger problem that there's there's less single target and syn actually
solves the problem of single target like that's why like i feel like like kaisa is good like a big reason why kaisa is good
is because is because she actually has a single target to kill some ers but like like the the fast nine
board unless you're giga ca and i'm talking about like like like everything
two start you're just
eigth oh fated and snip okay the fated plus
one's not actually that good though cu usually it's good with fated as ear but uh
all right well no one hopefully no one opens i i have this target dummy that i can't even use okay what's the
plan okay
i all right well hopefully no one
opens aphelios yeah i think rather f honestly
okay let me let me let me let me explain to you how i did the math i first sold them all like did i
sold them all my head and i said okay i make nine and then i was thinking all i have to do is sell one ahri to make 10
but turns out i have to sell the yasuo and ahri to make 10 or or to not to to only
make nine and then i thought it was at 12 go but i was actually at nine okay
whatever venerable piggy bank scoreboard scrapper all it's actually good i can
just i can just sack for tear on carousel hopefully no one opens
and i just transition the fated let me see if there's any fated players oh i think this guy's fated and
he has the thing this guy's fated for sure
oh scoreboard scrapper i think i mean he's holding the fated units so he might be playing fated what the please
but i but i will say wait i me wait at more like i'm not i'm not trying to be a negative nancy land like i'm trying to i'm trying to spread some positivity
here are you still here by the way hello
i i think i think what you're doing to like warden exalted behemoth was like it's kind of smart i was reading that and i was like oh bet
wed okay like i mean like okay you know it like i'm going just sell
it also i don't even want to play towards the fated line i mean doesn't the entire lobby look like they're playing fated like this guy's playing
fated i'm pretty sure he's playing fated as
well what okay should i just play snipers like i just play aelio thresh
like thresh front line i i don't really want to just like
seven way contest cuz like i mean this guy has patient study and he's trying to play fated
all right i'll just play towards ashe it's fine like what the is
this what the is this okay it's not it's actually not
that good though but the thing is if i if i if i just get fated plus one here i i have 10 fated on nine oh
man but i'm not to just play toward ashe
scoreboard scrapper i mean like there's no way he's not like like if he if he opens here he would he would have like
he would have opened already so he's already fated i mean this guy's chun rabadons with patient study this guy's
playing towards uh trick shot i mean this guy's fated plus one what else he's going to play oh this guy might be playing towards ashe actually he is he
might be playing toward kaisa he has no bows uh this might be playing towards kaisa as
well okay
um well i'm not trying to get my my cash out
griefed bo b belt bf aelio yasuo
please like it i just take out fortune one turn no i don't even have a fortune in my
shop the thing is like if i i can get a 20 charge regardless right let me go
this cuz like the thing is he's he's left corner is he full open i hope not
it's fine it just means i can push one more it's
fine cuz i i would have cash out here anyway i was just going to get a 20 charge but now i'll just push one more and maybe honestly this might be more
like it's not even that bad man like 75 hp like it's fine it's not a big deal
light
up by the way i just i just wanted to make it clear real quick if i get offered fortune plus one here you know
you know what fortune plus one does it heals me 6 hp six so do not do not say missed
fortune like like come on are you excited to play day one with me and not
really i mean the thing is emily like you're talking all this but like
you think i'm getting day one doesn't mean everything come
closer like i mean i know you're you're used to getting day one like like every single time but i mean like i mean yeah
not me in fact like it's my first time playing in day one like i'm actually excited to stom some
noobs yep
war hey did i actually win again
he's still open
please i mean it's fine it's
fine lowkey
i mean if it rolls a two like i have to push again
every is but then if it rolls a six i'm not just dead h no i one roll six it's all

good i l this for sure right
i go glove on carousel no matter what get the last down play around the
sword oh well i hope it doesn't roll six cuz if it does i don't know what to
do but else i should have just sa to the one
bro the entire lobby is playing towards syn what the
wait actually this guy has an ashe i think he's playing towards ashe and he has a spat for porum plus one oh man
bro should i just take this cash out like don't i win the game if i just
take this cash out not really ah whatever i'm just going to push one more who
cares the thing is if this guy
opens i mean i should probably just take it but if he pushes like it like i don't
like what's the game plan there's a syndra with the with the
bow oh it's gone the glove's
gone
huh what
okay i mean i'm just going to push first like i don't care like if he wants to just disneyland it up and and okay yeah
okay i rolled a three what is that 15 17 probably a 30
charge
ah oh god i'm about to get dumpster by everyone though holy
f let me show you
darkness do i just play towards like four sniper like kog maybe like kogmaw
aphelios and i just chang the front line a little bit
how many units i kill here zero oh that's not good i mean i get a 30 charger is actually pretty
okay it's said i'm like starting the game kind of low and i'm also playing ashe so if i do happen to miss i'm just
going eighth bramble dclaw late game specialist is going fast n
k ro fate hunts you kai call
let's see this guy opened like no way right i mean there's there's no way people open next round cuz they don't
even have enough hp to stack but i think this round like taking this loss is like who
cares i'm still i'm still going to be two lives
okay i'm worried that this board is too strong though like this board doesn't even look bad if i'm pairing yua with thresh and i have five fated in and i
have a guinsoo carry like if i run to someone with like no front line they actually get run over like lokia might
win never a dull moment i don't have a glove what's the game
plan glove please time for a
good also i can play six sniper in darkness we find
ourselves okay i mean is is bramble even good in this lobby or is it completely
useless since too i mean this guy's ad but it doesn't
actually matter i mean it's not that good but i mean i'm not
making it's fine it's fine like don't worry about it
it it doesn't even like if i'm killing units here it doesn't matter no matter what i'm two liv like who the cares like i kill units i don't kill units bro 18 is two lives it
doesn't even matter all right gg har is is actually
fine a toone do i even have
sniper in yeah all right nice i'm playing six sniper for sure never a dull moment
the last time i was
never okay i'm playing kaisa sniper i
guess is empty without so why does it look like no shadow
i'm i'm eighth i'm eighth i am
eighth i don't even know what the ink shadow is
vitality oh wait okay nice i'm still two lives
great bless okay i mean i mean okay i should probably buy some stuff i mean i need last whis where i can't play the
game also i mean i i i i also need to somehow play ink shadow but i mean vitality okay i need glove i mean
tg is huge if i can get glove here okay there is a glove okay i might be back then okay i mean this shot i don't have
to roll a single time i'm back all right gg's
do i even need anti-heal or
nah okay hear me out like i like now i don't have to roll
like i mean like i mean i mean yeah i mean it's fine like now i don't have to roll yeah deal i didn't even upg the ailio
oops this guy scoreboard scrapped the entire game and still got dumpstered i'm
back and then now i just play around the glove on carousel go for a tg or setp pass hard and i just go straight to nine
i'm back
i mean there's a set if i want umbral plus one do i want that i can go porcelain plus one not really i there's
an ashe but i don't really want
that is there any way i can get ink shadow in like i basically i i mean i can play
udyr over or i mean tattoo of vitality is like whatever though i mean all i know is my
front line needs some help this front line is uh is is just not
looking very good let me pair these two first of
all add some hp uh also these these two should probably
be attacking the same unit i should probably put main tank on this
side okay okay it's looking all right
yeah i kind of i kind of do want trick shot
though jax it has to beer like i'm not i'm not losing or for jax it's tattoo of
vitality oh i don't know this run i can sustain
oh bye-bye cra 2 full streak by the way combat caster an two syndra 2 okay how does this
guy have syndra 2 as well you know syndra is like seven way contested this lobby like i i how how is everyone just loading in
with syndra 2
hello and this guy pivoted to lilia this guy hit cer 2 this guy hit
cer 2 i mean this guy's kaisa i just grief this kais for no reason i mean this guy is just randomly playing ashe except not really he's level 9 with or 2
porcel plus one lilia 2 or not lilia 2 list 2 okay and this just playing kais
i'm just griefing as kaisas for fun but also i i mean this needs some attack spe this is actually just
terrible also i have i have to go maintain left i'm
going i i have sniper kaisa i mean i rather just play sniper like irelia or something
okay nice if i if i if i one life here like don't i just go eigth
probably but this kaisa this kaisa's as like this can't be
right like i can sell this and move items to like
irelia like irelia one is probably already better sniper irelia db i mean i is not
that good but this guy is not happy he's just sitting here like wondering why the
i have kaisa too but i mean i have to make
something golden nico bro like i mean i could roll down and just ni ashe and or
how many ors are gone they're probably all gone 1 2 three zero four five
six six gone
ashe must press okay then i level through vitality is not that useful
but oh oh i i miss click
that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first
g s sniper is only good if your front line can sustain it but if your front line is like bad like you don't even get
any value but i mean one of the sniper is from the thingy and the other sniper is from the thing so it's i'm basically playing for sniper
so it's not even
bad tear rod belt chain bf glove tear rod belt chain bf
glove i mean like i like am i really trying to go sunfire on or but i don't really want to
put items on aphelios my god this is the worst
this is the worst my
god car just go your item it's fine can i even level in two turns 64 if
i win the next two i can i just saw an irelia 2o with consum gs and his front
line is actually correct or 2 syndra 2 hey
undeniable i'm sure this he doesn't even have a spark and have a dclaw all right
bye-bye all right bet
and bro wasted nico how much is a level 64
46 55 plus 3 58 i can't even level
for this man all right i might just level for team o
deal i mean it's it's tattoo of vitality man who cares oh i n oh i n ashe oh oh wait i
found or too really oh okay oh this is a scoreboard scrapper
guy i mean damn it's all good scoreboard scrapper
bye-bye actually do i even need to lock bro this not a z in my next shop
like relax like i might as well just make the gold
i just got my stolen the i mean your is back but i don't even think i mean i i would have to sell this unit
to level so i i i mean i didn't do the math like 50 like let's say i made 50 here 60 60 61 plus plus three oh wait i
think i have perfect amount actually so that means i locked for no reason cuz i'm pretty sure is better than especially with the
spark i mean front line is front line that mean i mean i didn't sell ud
for no reason because i mean i wouldn't be able to level here and like lives are too important but also like i'm trying to get rid of the stupid ass kaisa i mean
ud is fine like even without the stupid uh tattoo of vitality like who cares uh i should probably try to give
him an item
i sorry i still want to play rel though this guy's attack speed is just
pathetic actually i could just play rakan or not rakan
z that is actually kind of good this is freedom
bro miss you de too
this gu's actually kind of strong bro these guys don't even look weak
what's going on over here i mean his sparks over here and
hopefully i can kill this by the time the spark attacks my by the time uh
it attacks my or cuz if the spark is gone there's no way my or dies is it dying hello ni i my
one's already dead i mean we got to half that's
okay oh mr soi
okay
okay i mean it's about to be a win out i'm getting one more front line item honestly my
aphelios i might just
uh like if there if there's like a is there a single item that's actually good
no in this matchup yeah not
really onbody we are made by our choices
he wouldn't wish my f on anybody hello i is this two lives
probably bramble doesn't do here i'm not giving items
correctly ah honestly 18 might be one life on stage six like if i take a bad loss not just
he's playing irelia carry by the time the casts his entire
board's already gone bro this irelia unit like it can't be right to like it actually can't be
right like i feel like irelia is like it it's only good when you have everything two star like like like way 2
rakan 2 wukong 2 or like this unit doesn't even do anything my carriers are just sitting here attacking for
free and it's like pretending to fight strength of
spirit wait what did he ff i was about to say cuz he didn't even bother trying to swap the spark onto the wor
have oh also i really need to be denying these as
ears this kaisa dps is a new level of
and what is this to the plan we have a
plan legends are told in word and deed like open cell i'm going to hit irelia
too i he's not going to hit two his ears yeah it he won't let me see if i hit a ear or not i'm i kind of scared
like i shouldn't have sold that a z i i i i should not have sold that a z because i think it's the only way i lose
if he hits to 0 two
undeniable hello hello
hello spirit
away i'm not rocking though that rock on porcelain open slot of
momo okay so why the did i take porcelain fat cuz i'm like looking at
this stick to the plan we have a why the did i take porcelain
spat i think i just got weaker in fact i know i got
weaker my default is getting hit immedately but honestly it's fine it's opposite side did i have you you're cute
today oh hello oh hello
hello oh it's all good


music] did they remove first on today's patch like come on like just read that sh like
it's not like this guy can't it's not it's not a real
comment oh my god what the
oh great trainer sentinels yay i mean i got fortune and porcelain
plus one and mythic plus one you can't miss all three wait holy wait you
actually can't miss all three
like you have to hit one of
them honestly like six person is even that good also i i didn't even look at my
shop like i'm not holding the right units there's no way i am i i just i didn't even i don't even i don't even i didn't even look
uh okay i already up like what is this i'm holding
trash i'm honestly these shops are not that good
okay i mean no matter what i hold this opener is not that good i where the trouble is
what what the
i'll just take the
gold and i i'll just i'll just make sure i play three mythic next round two
porcelain okay hold on i am lost or it's not like i'm actually lost
may it's more so this opener is just so bad my my head's
hurting come closer our wills align i definitely hold shen i don't really care
about the zyra this guy's fortune 21 okay i mean i i got make 10 here i'll
level next turn still make 10 belt chain glove see what en counter
is just play towards uh six porcelain or seven uh
or or 10 mythic six porcelain 10 mythic
creatures wait what the wait what
um i belt chain play around glove i me ian belt chain play around
glove i pour some plus one i mean do i beat this guy without slamming yeah the bro i two streak
do you see my board this is a two
streak
okay i this is this straight a blatant high roll i fought fortune and then i fought an
opener like i mean okay up for a showdown if i win the round i'm i can
just sell but i probably won't
win i mean i can i can sell and make 30 anyway is that even worth it i can just
pre-level yes what's the
ink tattoo of
fury
uh show youire sun
fire y i didn't kill a single unit yay
he's a golden eco on bench all
right i'm still last
pick as long okay as long as i have porcelain and and and mythic you can't miss you're rolling for two outs but if
it rolls tear one then you definitely can miss there there's nico i just go rod
like three r like whatever rod belt glove chain rod belt glove
chain like lowkey you can't miss fortune plus one either except i we need a mid game and i also
need to skip to annie i me i'll hold what's your
name this guy to see who i'm fighting i think i can kill three anyway like even if i don't slam like sunfire
merlo i don't think i'm going like i'm not going to win regardless shu maybe i can kill two probably could
have position my kate way better though cuz kate's going to be oh actually this one okay never mind i didn't kill
i should kill one here
honestly
oh okay i have fortune now i don't have porcel odds
okay can i okay one lux one amumu and i have all
three but i think the pry would
be i mean it's fort it's fortune for sure like like it's it's fortune plus one and then after fortune it's i i
guess it just depends on items like if i have a bow i'd rather have porcelain but if i don't have a bow i'd rather just have mythic i don't like mythic though i
think i think ted mythic can actually lose and then also getting to 10ed mythic is really
hard like you you you you like you have to roll on eight but also you need a way
and then also you need to be level nine whereas porcelain like you don't have to go like fast nine you do need a list but
like you can you can fit it on eight but the thing is that i need items for ashe or it's
you new friends save old me okay
well there's no porcelain
who is he talking
to bro 10 mythic 1. i mean yeah you're level 9 with way and most of the time you're level 10 i mean it better have a
1.7 like well no
okay well i didn't find the p sword so i only have mythic in in the thing i'm actually going to take out sniper because i don't even want to roll on the
first try sometimes you like roll on the first try and then you roll you miss i think i mean i think i'll know
right now what i'm going to play i don't even want to put in archinist i don't want to put in behemoth by
accident what the can i play all right whatever it kobuko y
all right i mean i'll know exactly right now like what i'm
playing unless it rolls tear one then i mean then i just have to commit but like whatever i mean if it rolls tear one i
mean also if i miss then i okay like
it's going to be
epic
yay oh please oh please
he hit mythic plus
one
five oh lord also i didn't even level here oh
lord all right am i just committing porcelain
then
probably oh bl
isn't my game a little too hard now

like this guy hit uh mythic plus
one this guy scoreboards scrapper heavenly plus one i'm playing towards the ashe
line oh what the wrath of the moon midnight siphon that's not good half dclaw on
bench i mean i'm going to cash out but then if i fight 10 mythic i'm just dead
unless i hit porcel plus one next if i hit porcel plus one next
into i mean there's annie for for five fortune but i really need a last whisper
but i mean it's fine i'm kind of down to heal some hp like i heal 6 hp it's not even that bad also it's not like annie's
a bad unit like it's it's good on my board or like it's good on my final board like it's actually a good unit so
it'll be fine also i can play like even if i don't hit portone plus one i can actually play like five mythic with way
like the mythics are actually really good it's lilia nautilus kgma and then i can just play h so my cap's like pretty
high even on eight if i hit h on eight also i have best friend which is like decent combat also i have rating
gold hey you know what i'm like you know what this spot's not even bad
i mean i'm pretty i mean i lose this anyway like it doesn't even matter i'm i'm not winning this
look at my board it sucks it straight up
sucks okay hopefully i can kill all but all but the
shen oh nice uh never mind it was looking okay until out of nowhere my
whole board back actually it one more wait okay it doesn't matter who
cares y i mean i'm going to cash out on like two lives like seven for is not even good i mean it's still pretty good
not really i have a guinsoo
this guy's mythic plus two i mean there's no way he's going to
open i mean if he opens like whatever man i'm kind of down to kill some units like he just needs to go 10 mythic
and he wins the game
okay i i need to say i need to start saving h tre soon one on eight
one more one more one more two more two more two more no no no one more one more one more
like what the please last time i at a pl was
never okay well i don't okay i mean no matter what i need to be playing porcelain here i don't even want mythic plus one
odds wait exalted is what aomo
yay tim actually i'm looking at my items actually no my items are actually fine for for the thing plus one i mean i can
also play no like i i don't not juming to like it's not even good my items are so bad and then like like if i play fortune here i fight 10 mythic while i
play seven fortun i'm just eigth like i mean that can't be right either i mean no matter what like my my spot sucks like i i mean i need to clear
bench oh man this is not looking good for me i don't even want mythic i i only
want i need to take out i mean the fortune i need a clear bench for fortune
odds glove bf bf glove and then i still have a glove belt
cloak to play around okay it's
fine i have to r eight what's my hp 31 there's a there's a this guy's about to
be 10 mythic two seconds in the game actually he's level 830 with two lives like maybe he just dies like i'll
just take fortune this heav i'm going to get
dumpstered 31 i mean there's fortune but like it's not actually
good n
no prison can hold me monsters are
everywhere spirit reveal our way
reveal our way i didn't even finish rolling i didn't even finish rolling sorry sorry i was i was too busy getting
happy i mean i mean hey my spot's looking amazing i'm
back honestly like it gun blade it's not even that bad ah nah
that i mean won the thing i i mean i win the game yay
do i even hold or
probably oh wait oh l what the
only cuz it's porcelain yeah k out of here no one
cares about you no disrespect
though okay i mean that's i mean it's not bad
i'm i'm i i'm three invoker but like i mean i'm six porcelain except i'm i'm ashe one so it's not actually
good um and then i mean i go last round on carousel like is there hold on am i
am i stupid am i missing something i i don't have to play nautilus but nautilus 2 is nautilus
2 also helps the mumu and i'm six porland and then i mean i know what the thing
is nah i just i just don't play war i just level for lilia there's no
way i'm rolling my board is like way too good like 40 charge cash out i think i'm
up i don't even know what my cash out was but i think i'm up two components i'm up two components or are two full
items oh wait i what did i even cash
out i i i i i don't remember making this adaptive helm
either or did i get the adaptive from the from the no i think i got rabbit on
no i got no i got rabadon's an adaptive okay oh wait no wait when the did i make this adaptive oh oh oh no it's my
augment okay it's my augment okay i was about to say we must press on okay okay
deal okay so i'm up two full items in in like like two legendary units and one of the airs is probably the
thing and then i'm just leveling for for lz or not list uh lilia i mean for
invoker and not two is not two it's actually kind of good did he make it to 10 mythic no he's level eight z all
right bet that's what i like to see it's just another
first fin
it's not it's not even that good cuz it like bro it's like kind of nullifies my fortune cash out no yes it does like
what the is this garbage man hello i mean i like this is actually good like
sh redemption is good but the runand nah yeah
whatever i mean blue buff is good on the dude i mean g okay this i mean this is fine i can just ga like ga the list and
then blue buff the lilia and then i'll just bramble the nautilus like it's fine like
whatever okay what is this that's a
whole i haven't scouted a single time but honestly i probably won the game
am die
okay y it really is another
first the game say have just been a little bit too easy i feel
like die
like i i could go warmog's front line but like is that actually good i i i like not really i i i don't i
hate guard breer though like no one's building a guard breaker i think i'm building a guard breaker cuz i
mean it's fine like i i i don't want to invest in front line my front line is way too
good bro missed nothing i got another worthless front line item also like am i going a
three i could also just solo or i don't really want to roll okay i mean i not just going
streight this guy's so strong actually what the is this he's also three exed somehow this guy's three lilia
three3 nautilus i don't even know why i'm going for nautilus 3 then he's he's 70 hp like the earliest like i'm just
sitting here holding holding 30 gold on bench for no reason okay what the am i
doing okay what the am i i didn't even scout man like i i just i minus one
for making it and then i minus another gold for like come on
fate is in
our okay okay listen hear me out it's actually not that good because i i don't
have i don't have a i don't have orin and i'm not like it doesn't even have any dryad stack so like how squishy he is like in a zer2 a two star legendary
1.6k hp like i mean and then i can't even play oron for like a while like
he's actually pretty like squishy but also like here all i have to do is a night restar for cost and i i
just like guarantee win like i'm i'm going to natural the lily eventually there's no way i need to roll my board is too good i'm going to natural the
list eventually i can just 10 on on 61 and then i can just level for or
no is written except by
us uh is this good for me or no
it's fine i mean it's really good for this guy but oh i'll pick it i just take
highest gold sure i mean now i i'm kind of down to roll for
dryad actually wait i can i can go nine for exalted like what is it alon alon
thres kobuko alon i but i mean like no matter what don't i
want drad and least now so i can get some stacks actually like now that i'm just going to go or plus uder and just call it a day i mean it's not
like nah these units are terrible you
man it's just the
first is this like close to ker 3
no i can also just level for like way h plus
uh plus uh plus or how many like i mean it's it's like whatever it's scaling 200
200 hp on zer is not even
bad uh is anyone going three star for cost no
no no
okay this is boring gg's uh and my cash out was good it was a 40 charge and i got two full items my
cash out was adaptive rabbit
on or wait was it no no no it
was it was it was oh r it on cg rb it on cg and and and in hiser and in some
other or five cost i

think he's a high roller each time he about getting anything he gets it yet he's still bitching
question mark question mark 20 question marks bro you're not a tft player if you don't complain like come
on like that's how i know you suck relax
buddy i will not hold
back what am i leveling for again oh or
way i'm not the sack one cuz i'm i'm is going to send it to true zero
after also like i'm i'm pretty sure with
how much gold i have on 10 like like i can just wait for this guy to die he's holding like he's holding two air one
ashe like i can actually go three star a three star ashe with how rich i am
it sound like i needed to win
though no prison hold
me i will not hold back hello i will not hold back

back sorry sorry i got lost okay
sorry spirit reveal our
way do i want to hold the n this i don't even know how i'm play with here like i'm kind of down just play or plus
wa like five mythic is not even bad uh he's holding one ashe but he's
probably going to be dead soon cuz i'm going to fight
him surr my tri is inevitable
honestly no one cares about the i bro this way doesn't do anything i don't care what let you

i you back you're cute today this is kind of close
i think i think it's only wion is hitting silus 3 like whatever i'll just hold him this for the rest of the game g
not really no prison can hold me we are made
by our
choices heon 3 that's okay
i'm pretty sure my back line can't just get one shot i refused to make gargoyle it
doesn't do anything actually that's not even true it's not even bad i definitely do not need to hold
three of these also i mean this doesn't do
anything am
why is this guy still in the game is the real
question to be seen i mean he can't he can't hit
agre i mean i might as well buffer a five cost
i mean i can also go lilia and nautilus like lilia or nautilus i might as well just buff for a five cost like maybe i
just go a z3 i don't think i can i can go list three though yeah you know what it i'll just go list
three like it looks like i'm poor but i'm rolling on 10 odds and then i'm guaranteed to make it to neutrals and
then neutrals is another 10 gold on top of like i'll be like 30 gold post i just need to find i just need to find three
more lists which and like it's not even unlikely like it's actually not
i
am but like like like on a real note like why is this guy still in the
game be my can i who knows who the knows wish
my on anybody
oh yeah i should probably swap now cuz i i have the thing oh yeah you're right
it's a two star way it's not even
bad i am a destiny halts for no
one i shadow the spirits i feel closest to
surrender my tri is inevitable i
never i'll find a way again my journey only beginning oh
i never i bet wait oh wait i might actually win this
fight oh no oh oh i just realized i need a front on my assh or something like
selling his ear like my board's not even that bad with
me wait the yonan might kill my a okay alune okay my ashe is
dead all right bet gg's
surrend my in chat you're welcome honestly i'm like
sitting here talking to this guy and he just he just gives me a free win like this i mean and then he allows to like you guys to see list three
yay yay of the
past legends are told a word end
indeed subb n i'm too scared i don't know why i'm
scared a i even have ga on it


would you rather sh out a watermelon or pee out a golf ball bro i i don't care i
like i don't know i mean neither

oh what the how long have i been in game for
wait yeah i am that
good hello what is
this when life gives you sour bandle berries f bandle
will you put up a good
fight hello i changed the slightly pants it is so cold in this house i don't
get it maybe should turn on the
heater i'm too
lazy i know where the trouble is yeah i i sold garen by accident that's
great reaper crust with a kindred it gives a kindred
reaper crest gives kindred i just play four
reaper pump was way better just default
okay so why did i sell my garen honestly okay yeah i don't know why
i sold my garen who the knows is there a bruiser here
i also need to hold the zyra though honestly i just don't level one turn it come close i know one's holding this
my destination is c
oh okay well gg's
pumping up diamond hands okay i mean this is a top two for
sure man they hate watchers are just sitting here just disappointed now that
sucks for you
wi well i need some damage the ser is not doing unless civer is stronger
than duelist is itory is it's not umbral okay like this
or this i probably do right my is not even bad
wait this guy has diamond hands the
high rollers my my darius just straight up
died to splash damage like come on

okay probably not playing fed from this sp i'm up shojin shojin
umal time in hand stus y yeso y
alon i i can actually just play
i don't know something
okay i mean i would go but also like am i even playing towards
story from this spot like is this not towards like an alon angle i hold yon forget the past it
onlys the future i can also hold atr i'm not playing this anymore
let me show you that and it looks like i'm poor but that's cuz my board is worth 7,000
gold and it doesn't matter i'm still getting a gold to turn no matter what i can for to it not my fault and i'm holding like i'm
holding like 7,000 gold on bench but it's fine i find one alune i'm probably just
going to play uh sis umbral pump it up shojin diamond hands
cloak except i'm pretty sure like shojin is not even good on a loon i'm pretty sure bis aoon is like it's like nash's
tooth archangel plus one and you just you just try to like instead of going for spam cast like
like nas is like a half shun more ap you just try to one shot the backline like m
yeah and the game plan is to just one shot them before they can kill
you or like you just like you just one shot them cuz like alune targets the highest hp but the thing is like it the
moment you tickle him once you'll never hit the backline again but like if if you you just one
shot yeah oh my oh my
out of darkness yeah okay yeah just wra it
up yep gg's not really
two alune four umbral mid game i'm loading in with a warmogs on my
entire board and they're not even one star garbage like like i mean i have darius 2
alun jojin diamond hand spark
okay uh remover infinite gold i i'm just taking gold unless unless remover is actually
relevant here the thing is i have diamond hit and like i no not really bro miss hro 3 is
not always a release i making 20 making 30 making 40 42 send silus 2 out of
nowhere also i don't even have to play umbral still but i probably will i have two
alons darius 2 york parod yon
how is this guy 50 gold by the
way he's full streaking with kobuko 2 lucky
pause he has three items
kobuko he's full streaking level four
is someone has ro to the moon oh oh thank you you scouted for me i mean i can also just push levels
like if i natural alon 2 like i'm just going to play alen 2 until like whenever
but i mean he doesn't have a single
what the
i mean it's like it's it's actually pretty good i like i don't know how else to say it like it's pretty good
the power of a dragon
a like you can actually play least and final board it's not even
bad pause champ it's coming
what okay i mean okay i i'm not dropping
no one's playing this he hit kobuko
3 here you go pet
52 wait what oh oh is it boss bos raid wait did i already miss it bro i have no
notifications oh i did miss it yo boss bos thank you for the raid thank you thank you thank you i uh yeah yesterday
someone hosted me and then that 20 minutes later they said by the way you missed a rate and i like wait what and then i feel kind of bad cuz i'm
pretty sure they're never hosting me again i appreciate you thank
you i i mean i i don't even know how to open up my yeah it was arya
yeah this h's looking pretty good tiniest titan radiant relics lucky
gloves garbage garbage garbage i mean these are all garbage garbage i me tiny
bit deadly is okay but i already have pumping up but i mean i mean there's no way i'm taking al hold
on okay there's no way i'm taking rain r from this spot i mean you miss too easily and then bow en counter
and then okay i mean i mean i don't know why the i'm i'm rolling this okay also i probably should have taken out du
before i rolled i mean let me let me roll this like bar treasures is way too slow and also like no i mean tiny bit
deadly wow wow
okay but the thing is like don't i still lose sup
precent and he has no items and now i'm i'm i broke 40 i have a kobuko no synergy on
my board but i don't really want to uh spark the i mean i could also just
diamond hands and commit spark to it but i'm pretty sure like this is i try to go fast nine like le in two i just try to fast n
with the le two i'll get items for him eventually
tiny bit deadly pumping up this know i'm playing like more than two duelist i
already have way more than enough attack speed 15 plus 30 45
okay but like wow how the
okay my destination i don't get it i mean bro like you know this could have
just been a silus 2 like it actually could have been
so i took prismatic ticket that guy looks like he's going
eigth le looks like he's a six

coest all right bow red buff is good but i also wouldn't mind chiv oh
wait no i have never mind i have spark i am i really getting a bow as last pick maybe who knows
he's on a one cost and there was already another bow who knows yeah i mean who
knows oh my the year is 20169 tft is no more so
you entance this house after long bro this like you forgot to
bow 28 as you wish
kobuko how much hp does this guy have an extra 240 that's not even damn all right
shun red buff i mean i really need some damage on on this uh alon but honestly like i'm probably just pivoting to h or
morgana anyway just going straight to nine full cap exalted is
garbage so level 710 i don't think he has a single alien
level 740 leas in 2 also this uh this encounter actually
blessed me as well the h encounter cuz it f me gold both rounds and then also uh it made me it made me the next econ
interval and then it made me the next econ inal again so it's already up four gold the i right
bet it's looking

good i mean i'm kind of done to roll a little bit though like at least alon to
i i can't just load in with with a in zero item alun one shun
red and then like expect to go n i'm pretty sure i lost also how is pren even losing rounds cuz he entered the stage
like 95 hp so i think he lost two rounds this stage which i don't even know how cuz how the does anyone beat him i
think i beat him i guess his augments are are like terrible he's bulk except not really i
think i'm getting dumpstered oh i i i nullified the entire
al oh hello oh bye-bye 900 health
execute all right
bet wow wow i mean that's pretty good i mean i'll allow that yeah kobuko
out of here peace gg i'm going straight to 10 oh my i am a fcking
beast yeah diana next next shop j next shop like it doesn't even matter like i mean i
mean holy rod rod belt belt i mean i just got some free damage as well
warmogs i mean warmogs is not that good but i mean it's all right i mean i got rabbit on that's all i needed okay it's
not even that good like where the is the uh and there's altruist behemoth
reaper i mean all i know is i'm playing for umbral i mean that's fine i mean i'm just making my items who cares i
mean what i going here so glove pryo rabbit on warmogs i hate warm on this
unit qiyana altruis behemoth i mean like is there any reason to level like what am i leveling
for nothing i also don't have to make warmogs i can go no i mean i don't like this item but
that's all right like is it this le not even that good he actually has zero
items unable that was beautiful baby this
reminds me of our first level 820 sent
it there's no way i'm rolling here
i'm zoee what's your name support cash garbage these are all garbage salvage
bin i wouldn't even mind dragon lord plus one no
who the am i missing
okay oh okay bet i mean i like i mean bet
was there something else i could play probably
what was it not reaper j i play triple
nico am i cing around nico
here i'll hold one of
them i'm definitely dro in i i might i might actually end
with i don't know
something also let me i mean let me see pressing sp level 830 qu printing bro i don't even know if
i like how do i even out cap this like did he already win the game
i have a i have a zoe on my board like surely there's something better than
zoe like shen behemoth i mean there has to be
something better than zoe like there's no way it's zoe
also i just natural like true b i just got rakan warmog spark diaman three item there shun red buff rabadons i got
i just perfectly finished three tank items three three uh ap items like oh my
god i haven't rolled a single time this entire game like what's going on here
okay oh yeah no raan's broken raan's actually working i i honestly like should i just roll an here like i should
i should roll like like even like seeing two shops like there's no way i don't hit like sraa or diana they're both like
the biggest spikes sraa or diana i mean like you have to like
there's no way you don't hit in two shops and my board goes from like a 8 out of 10 to like a
9.5 you actually can't even miss if you wanted to i don't really want belt though
but is there anything else i want not really i don't really want bow okay i'll just take this
soraka also i can drop yon
and uh not really i mean four umbral is not even that bad right now like darius
2 buffing the lease in i mean i definitely drop out of umbral eventually and i probably just go
towards i don't know i al he just sented i'm fighting him
yay yay that's okay
wait what
okay all right bet i mean just look at my combat
arugment pumping up tiny bit deadly combat caster okay but like like like do i even
beat prent look out oh wait oh wait actually can i out cap him with this like what's
his gold 50 gold he's still farming with okay like really like am i actually out capping
that though i mean this is really good for me i have so much attack speed and the comic's hp and i just gained infinite ap theast
or 18 ap that's still a lot the future the thing is i don't even know if
i'm out have in press event like he's a giga tank here shja morello it's not like his items are bad bulk
three
spark i'm probably just going to 52
sended wait he's not forcing the bruisers and also like kabuka like bro
this kabuk unit is actually kind of good oh man i think i lost i'm fighting
silus two zas okay that's okay i'm surprised i even
won the previous fight also al was one duw lotus 3 rakan
right k
gas oh i dm' it to you on discord i didn't even see wait what is this bro what the what the did you
even dm me it's just a it's just a pog
what another belt yeah i lost their by my hand every flow blims to be
seen yeah i lost also i need to play
around list uh i mean i can go another like i
mean i can go redemption i can also just i mean i should probably build another ap car yeah i can't just load in and and
my only carry is i mean i could go steraks and play towards wuhong
too instead of another ap
carry i can just remake this one over i'm stacking one here i'm about to level and send it hope i find one way and then
maybe i go for a three star four cost con all right bet sounds like a
plan actually i don't even want to send it it's a it's a encounter here actually but the thing is like
don't i just want a
list i'm trying to get listen asap
yeah no but there's still yorick like yorick one goal to roll i don't know why that's in the game
but like i'm kind of scared how about i roll into ler
way trade offer the power of
aagon to be i mean no one's playing this
okay there okay there's also a
wukong my journey is only beginning okay i mean like i i feel like
this is like like like it's fine to sit on this for a little bit lilia too i
probably cap around for invoker here with uh or udyr
azir beautiful baby that zero he's he's buffering the paint he's looking for one
way i mean
great like have around four invoker i mean after like as soon as i see this encounter i'm just sending it here i
don't really want to lose any more hp also i can go for like le and three wi con i key
okay i mean that's actually pretty good for
me oh the power of a
dragon i know what's play this to the plan we have a plan wait no one no one's
playing this like i don't even know why i'm playing this garage he's also diana belt bf chain
glove glove belt glove belt belt bf bow belt this is necessary this doesn't do
anything anymore heon irelia
okay i mean i kind of need a wh so i can start painting and then my windon is to go for three star and also need like a irelia unless i
want to just cap around morgana i want to cap around morgana really this reminds of our
this oh list is nothing wait what i already have the
thingy great what the is this innervating
locket i mean okay honestly like yeah n this unit like no one's coming around this shall i prove them
right and i can sell darius and alon but
like our way like i think my wion here is le in three
that's my wicon there's a
silus azir silus protectors val titans i mean air like i mean i kind of
need some some two star like i mean i need h le in three that's my wi con i mean irelia worthless i mean let
me get rid of this get rid of this okay rock on to i mean i can play
irelia but not really i mean we're too okay we're too i mean i could play irelia
this is my board can you just look at my board real quick this just looks like the
trest like don't i need a so i can start painting and i can play or as
well but i don't like i don't have a single one i play oru
deer justy i mean i rock on too but
like a like uh this board like i the thing is like it's strong enough to go second but like there's no way i beat
this guy man like i can't this kobuko is 8k hp rock on 2 as
well oh my like are people holding leasein he has one lease
in all right let me see if i can find a way like i mean like don't i need this way or i can't play the
game another air okay wa all right yeah
you i mean i kind of want duelist though
and then i have i have this udyr just sitting here doing nothing but at least i'm painting so i actually have a wi con
four rounds if i can survive four rounds i maybe hit at least in three and that's my wi
con yeah that was beautiful baby this
reminds me of our first day i found my first w y i mean i don't even think i can kill this this kobuko is not
balanced he's painting le in i can't even hit le in three so what the the game
plan i mean maybe irelia 2 can
win to i can also play like or
air like i drop this for air and then i play bn over
someone i mean this is sage plus heavenly heavenly altruis rock on 2 for
dlord i could also drop down to 2d lord but like i mean i would i would lose jenna
plus i mean it's just a zero overweight
down i feel good anyone else want to try whatever it maybe i can just go
nine and just give it pleas in yeah deal
that just goes here i can also just i mean i i could i mean i i probably should roll here i i
can go hodge hodge i mean sterox whs i mean i can go
hodge but i have sage and i have combat caster like titans are hodge titans are
hodge i'm kind of down for
titans all right deal
i feel like it's so much hp siage i mean also like should i just
roll i refuse my bo's not even
bad i have your you're today i don't think i can go for l
though he's just painting le in
but honestly like maybe he dies and he'll just let me hit least in three like he's actually
losing my journey only begin okay how do i play a
z2 i mean i i can play a zero over
this f is in our hands guard breer shun rabon's guard
breaker and then i red buff
and i just rub off way if i remake
way but also i can actually not in two turns or i can just roll i mean he's
painting the dude cuz also like i mean it's just or i just sell i just sell way you're today
oh also i just realized like why the am i playing doist if i have uh honestly i don't even need le 3 as my
wicon also he's i mean he's not painting lee but it's so hard to
hit i mean i mean i i mean i i can't i i mean it's one gold it's one gold it's fine
whatever my level for or irelia over h except i probably just play
h this game or i can also just go three items on wukong remake the lease
in three item wukong remake the lease in or on nine board strong enough to win i
mean i i mean this guy's just one leas in so there's only like not many like left i'm not just going to sit here and
roll like a idiot okay 64 like like titans or titans steraks plus
one i mean i don't think i don't know if i'm beting this guy though looks a little
strong i'd rather paint white3 or two i
mean you know i'm stressing but i i i think i'm doesn't air actually counter this guy i have combat caster and then
this this kobuko is just sitting here wasting ults on these stupid ass soldiers oh okay all right gg
bye-bye wait he's about to get ao
too um plus one crown guard bow i mean there's leas in and then i can go lee in
three yeah not really
it doesn't change whether i hit it or not
okay wukong two show
the wouldn't wish my f on anybody i mean i refused to print the
stupid ass lease in i'm just trying to p print away do i even lock this
trash i mean i i just need to find this ho aap it's kind of hard because this guy is about to print a away never mind
he found he natural it cuz he still okay i i'm level 9
though my with with anyone else want to try what oh wait oh wait what the
wait where the did i get this gold from wait
what
never okay well i need this one piece of sheet i mean i could also move items off of h but i feel like h is actually doing
stuff like i could play i could play irelia instead of and then go red buff this and then like
red buff irelia and then shun rabit on air agreed in this matchup or should i
just say who or just stay as is let let let me let me let me see if i
lose like if i lose i'll i'll swap if i cuz i i can't even paint
it do want later
this remind of our
first i mean it's all good all i needed was a uh natural rakan natural b items
straight to level 10 all right yay even i can win


i mean maybe maybe i actually go like nautilus mana item i kind of like that more nautilus mana
item cuz or is always giving
what it splits with the what hello what
the do you mean look at
oh why the it's my cs is still patching how many like how big is this
patch i alone decide my
fate it's like 10 gigabytes i haven't played cs in like two years and like the last time i played cs
it hasn't been two years but the last time i played i played like for 10 minutes this game used to be so
fun i mean it probably still is fun i just i mean i don't play anymore though i played them like in high school y i
know where the trouble
is you so three game it i am that
good
spirits are
calling i mean i have five yasuo that's
pretty good except it's really hard to hit cuz a lot of people just hold them early mid
game there already like at least five's gone
no one is promised tomorrow oh
o okay a my items are so bad but i don't care like
whatever life is
good my items are bow rod bf oh my lord
oh my lord i mean i just go spark on carousel this is just this can't be
right this one's got
fire like i i mean this cannot be right i don't have any dclaw
like like tris is dclaw redemption plus one it's dclaw redemption spark sunfire is fine as well but i you're telling i'm
just loading in with uh with nothing
please i mean i have a
rod it's fine it's fine i have six kukos it doesn't matter
like it's not going to matter man also here let me let me actually backline them and then maybe i can kill
i just try to kill one
unit and then have them all target the same
unit left
bob bf
rod all right you guys got it
y the wrong one killed it man b titans and that is
terrible you heal way more by just uh you heal way more by by going decl redemption cuz he has so much hp but the
uh i mean if if i had a chain here i probably would slam it like like i mean if i had a chain here like titans like i'm send titans i don't give a but
like i mean yeah and usually when you have this augment like it's it's actually pretty
strong early mid game and you can actually farm some like like if i had a single makeable item on this kobuko like wouldn't i actually farm
some stuff probably in darkness we find
ourselves but i mean i yeah i got nothing this is the
worst i'm probably playing kaisa backline since i
bobf oh it's it's about to farm one oh bet
and plus two gg's oh oh okay it's fine it's fine okay
okay it's fine it's fine it's fine like yeah autos count as well thought i was about to get ks again okay if i don't
get this component here i'm going
eighth oh okay i mean that's pretty good got my my first cloak i need two
more cloaks i need a belt in a deer redemption dclaw spark b bf what's the toxin
except i don't even think i don't even know why i'm asking it doesn't even matter what the toxin is i probably can't even play ink shadow
anyway the past
all right not
bad now i just need cloak cloak belt
tear and i just want to be clear the last two games so like not the last games in
today's stream there's two people like there's two people that got lucky paws right when did they hit their kobuko 3
3-1 yeah so i'm expected to to to hit on 31 here
right okay
deal and then as soon as you as soon as you hit kobuko 3 you just went out you just kill everyone instantly so where
are the kobuko
also i mean i'd rather play towards ap than this trash like highkey i can't even hold
zyra not really it's not worth the econ
oh man that auto wasn't a hold on all right i'm just
saying i'm just saying i'm three off at
morello hit kabugo 3 on 51 bro if i don't if if if i don't hit on on 35 at the
earliest i'm just leaving bro what
huh like 35 at the latest like i'm going to roll to i'm going to roll to like 30 here and if i'm one off i'mma send it
oh i didn't even know this worse on neutrals it's lit oh oh another
cloak they call me jolly they're
right okay i mean that's pretty
good oh redemption okay i mean i mean that's pretty good oh oneof kobuko oh
yeah natural kobuko it gg's two
spirits are calling this game is over this game is
over it's actually just over all right bet and you know what
like let's i'm down to just play fortune for a little bit like it doesn't even matter if i win or lose who the
cares never mind never mind can i get fortune out of here like like never mind never mind
like i mean like i mean i'm down if it doesn't roll honestly even if it rolls six i mean four bru is pretty good
though n cuz now cuz like the thing is like i'm going to start winning rounds so it's like it's not actually good like
nah fortune build bt no one's building bt it's redemption the thingy and then you
just call it a day the game's over i i i guarantee you this game's over the
moment i get my second item whether it's dclaw or redemption gg all right honestly gargantuan like is
that even that bad gargantuan
kobuko do i even want bruiser augments sure let me roll this in this
first oh never mind there's martyr okay pandora's
items uh are
fine no prison can hold me man so boring i don't get
it uh i'm i'm not to just stay 50 though this world needs hope
de club
redemption
hello i'm getting kabugo 3 skills 20 hp or 20 hp per per
econ it's just so unreasonable just wait until i get dclaw
wait wait which one's better first deco or redemption i don't even know
oh okay i'm going straight to nine okay okay gg's
i think i'm going fast 10

actually your face so ugly yeah you will
sp
i forgot to pop it oops i mean it's
fine you know what deserved games have been hard thank you this is deserved i would have to
agree

i go where the trouble is should i just greed like honestly i'm kind of down to just greed tr bis
because uh no matter what like i'm not going straight like the fastest
nine i'm just playing towards
z i'm not going to bother popping
this honestly i'm like looking at this you know now my silver actually kills stuff and i'm i'm
getting my kobuko ksed so i'm not losing gold there's no way this kobuko loses a
single fight oh man i'm getting chs
now oh man

i mean like there's no way i don't get gold but like at the same time do i even need the
as i mean do i actually lose a single fight i might actually lose to this guy
four dryad 550 is's kind of strong the i'm fighting him wait learning to spell oh he doesn't have anti-mr oh okay
my okay my silence died instantly okay he doesn't have anmr he literally cannot kill my he wanted
to okay why the did i say i might
lose this is not even
close wait what but i will finish them
yeah whatever
it okay there i mean there's no way that's right like bro this unit just sits here and stuns stuns himself half
the
time cloak belt glove bf size does mean
everything i tris on on z is keep up
last ib but also gs is really good but tris is db if it's
z also i kind of want some anti-heal before before anything i should go anti
heal first it's and bf yeah
but like like it's not even that good cuz i'm getting ksed and then i'm down to just decall my
stus en counter in two turns
impenetrable bullar pandora's
items i mean i don't like i mean i can go prismatic bruiser does that even do
anything i mean it's not rainy it's not bullwark it's not pandoras tiny but dead is fine lucky gloves radiant
relics bulk bulk okay do not say bulk do not say bulk do not say bulk hp on hp is

terrible travel awaits
okay losing one gold here actually that's not even true i can just sell this trash
okay look at my board
it just looks
pathetic i'm carrying a cver it's all good bulk d bro it's terrible
oh man that's prett good oh that's pretty
good the power of a dragon i mean i'm probably just going to go 10 on like i'm like i'm i'm probably going to lose
rounds coming up but that's okay who cares i lose i lose it doesn't really
matter i'm sitting here farming
listen your prismatic is going to be four turns that's your prismatic four turns of

50 hey whole team
really like is it relevant on civer and teemo not really is is it really relevant on sylas no not really i
mean ho time for a good
gs and the other other thing are both good
okay encounter is coming up the power of a dragon i think i think i can lose to i
can lose to l ashe oh i'm fighting oh oh tk3 what the i mean it's fine it's
it's ash1 no db snipers focus but like i mean it's any two three
items i might like can i actually kill this i mean i'm i'm sitting here with 5,000
gold i i mean okay that's okay okay is this a real loss not
really my carry is a civer also what the is
exalted oh i might actually play exalted this game i mean i am for sure that last until used how many more turns of this morgana
do i have i mean like i should i just use them on this stage bro the 100 hp like don't i actually play exalted
this game like i can just play tk like civer zia civer
zia tk morgana and then i just m morgana
yeah oh no it last until use i'm not using on odds the
oh this gu to lad as ar miss that can't be
good that's okay as soon as i get these zoo carries going i just went out it's
all good it died
instant like don't worry it's not a real loss it doesn't matter also i'm pretty sure his al is
actually a bait because cuz i i want to drop the four bruiser for sure and actually play real units i go where the
trouble
is like i'd rather just play civer civer 2 teo2 kaisa 2 zia 2 and just play four
trick shot backline no uh what's it called it's fine four bruiser four trick shot plus
some garbage actually wait i mean wait why don't i just play oh wait i just play oh i just don't play aatrox wait it's not
a bait what the i mean aatrox i might as well upgrade for now i just play five briser and then
sixer the am i saying i
am encounter
one i mean gum blade straight up terrible i have rod
rod belta bf gs and then rod
rod i mean rather just r it on this and then have a belt to play
around i go ks what's he
exalted like lux civer tk aos morg like
all right this my last loss just watch this this kabuk already carry me to 950
gold i'm coming for you bl to be
seen we are made by our choice i mean i refused to play the thing
everywhere like i'm not playing i'm not playing the thing if it's uh i mean like like six bruer is better
if it's not zia that was never i i i didn't even
put the right okay it's fine i could also just go two trick shot here i probably should
like i can go six bruiser two trick shot since i have zero
zas and just go tk plus uh plus morgana save
your yeah can i even fit that
probably iy not to i will finish them but i mean it has
to be morgana cuz i refuseed to uh anywhere i don't really i don't even
want to roll anymore like civer is the
thing wait what's exalted wait what morgano over this oh and then tk
over some trash but i don't really want to roll anymore i don't know what's playing this cver bard
i i mean no one's playing lck no one's playing this
garbage cuz i still want to give kab a little hp my bo's pretty good after getting a
carry it's cuz he's a demon
i there bruiser plus one if i play eight bruiser i i'm definitely down for that a
bruiser is a
bruiser okay well then but then then i just don't play exalted i mean i don't have to play cer like no one cares about
the stupid ass attack but he doesn't do anything
except i won't sell cuz i can sell this like i'll bruiser this cuz i can
still go nine here and go uh civer over teemo and nine for
morgana and like i mean that board is a guaranteed first i mean it's a probably already a guaranteed
first merlo morgana
and then i can also cap around z over kaisa 7.5 the total is 16 point whatever
a good fight but like this kobuko like never solo carries like like the comp like you just you just go level 9 and i
mean the kabugo is good like don't get me wrong he's a carry but like i mean it makes it like you just cannot lose a round on stage three and stage four and
then you just go nine and then you just cap around like du carry h du carry zia du carry kaisa and then i mean yeah your
board's illegal
yay morello over this civer or c
morgana i'm done to just true hero if i win this round i win the
game this how much is it it's 6% of your max bonus okay saar
honestly i already have enough single target yeah yes is better for sure
7.9
okay last for ie gs rabit
on let's move i've got people to
inspire gs are steadfast on on silus this like has no no like like armor
doesn't really do anything i'm not just go gs gs fast this all
ap all right it's my last loss
legends are told in words end deed burdens of the past one more l i'm
done rolling stick to the plan we have a
plan level 10 three exalted okay
i'm going to play zia too over kaisa that's
it
try hooray time for a good m probably going to have f there's no
plays this we are made by our choices
i think he's playing it out y he's six he's at not even even weak by the way he's six drad five
fated is he kind of strong d plus two or or d plus one i mean i mean he he
does look pretty strong bro has no anmr wait really oh you're
right wait he's actually really strong though i just realized learning to spell 258
246 he's not even weak
the order is
given so
oh hp check 8.5 i'm still getting 120
roll for what i mean if i lose that's i mean maybe maybe the maybe it's it's a 20 hp
diff like 120 hp diff who
knows wait where do you get the spark from i think it's
dead look what you made me do all bet acceptable


like like for the people that did type question mark if you could think before you you hit enter on your keyboard like
that would be wonderful because i see that i'm not even mad at you well no i am no i'm mad
no i am i mean i'm not mad at you i'm mad that that like like the world could
have like people that like like that are just like like
yeah okay anyways
i'm hungry i let see certain wants any
food oh prismatic party all right maybe it's a kaisa game kaisa
w heon i mean i'm pretty sure prismatic
party you can actually just hard for thisa that is not balanced i mean no one's playing
uh i forgot what it's called oh koga like like you chogath koga in
prismatic like what like what the three can you even
hit for you to knock a w mythic plus one jw lotus
and it's a call game it's a c game let me hold everything for one turn see one chop and then i'll i'll i'll i'll commit
it's a c game it's a c game
he lost to
neutrals i'm just going to make
econ i can make hog here yeah you know you don't hold that garbage
bury treasures three items i mean that's pretty good le not caretakers no not that all right build the bud or not
build the bud i mean tear that's
fine i mean i'm 7 cog it's about to be natural and i'm going straight tonight after they call me jolly they right
all right i mean mythic plus one d lotus three is probably the three best or the
the other two best or
no i either way i'm just going to stack the stage might just look at the
stats three except i don't even think i'm going cha 3 this
game he's too unfortunate
my best being lucky loves is fake oh it is wait the best is barri treasures what the oh
fair treasures du lotus 3 what is this oh
i am living
change i mean is it is it five
turns like lowkey do you ever just like i'm kind of down to just lose econ actually i mean i have to hold
these okay there's no way i'm losing econ if i don't even i don't even have two pairs
and then just roll one copy but if you have like pandora's bench it's actually worth it to to lose
econ but it's only pandora ben for five
turns i mean don't i just win this game wa also why the am i not sending nashers
i just two stre making 22 streak of playing like i
have never seen kma win a single round on stage two oh i'm one
off yes
this story is not yet
finished okay i'm getting an awful lot of uh i think i three
streak never mind i got
dumpster this guy's board sucks okay i guess my board is just worse i
mean it is this world needs

hope no 30 it's it's it's uh it's bro it's ch it's
darus going have to go colo it's half dclaw half spark
is this darius 2o no now
what there's a
n oh strong unit
i mean i'm not to roll mal fight no one cares about mal
fight never
okay this game
sucks hello how many more turns
one i mean i'm kind of down to roll next turn just so i can pair the the
one cost or like i'm down to roll like one last turn of two star one cost actually that's not even true cuz i'm
pretty sure if i hit cog 3 i'm not going to just sit here and roll for choat
3 but like bro this com without ch got 3 is is straight up suck but i mean i can like i i mean i
i've cog seven and then like you can like you can
just push levels and go for way but you still like yeah
what oh yes he's hungry oh i mean yeah oh i mean i'm down and gg's oh
bet okay so how come i'm just sitting
here are i mean i still like i'm not even kidding like i'm i'm i mean i'm still
down to roll on how how many how many shops do i have
one more i mean i'm still down to roll until mal fight 2 cho two and k 2 i mean
i have to it's it's not expensive like i need like i can't just sit here with
nothing i got a glove tear okay these hot

up for a showdown
witness okay i mean i don't really want to go i
don't really want to go spark first because it's just going to die but like what if i hit je lotus i don't really want to go jg
either okay i i'm down to go i'm i'm not just go spar like i i i like i mean like i'm too
scared cuz it's prismatic party and the chances of me hitting du lotus here is so
high and also if i don't have a spark i'm justf
about to play i don't even know if two for one i mean that can't be my prismatic i
can't you invest a prismatic to give is mythic plus one even
good hedge fund blinding speed red buff i mean it's
not this it's not that it's not this i am too scared i am too scared
to take to roll to roll this like what the oh my this is just the worst i
think i'm going eighth again i no matter what i'm
leveling this is the worst i mean should i just make make gs
this guy hit tiniest titan i mean like i'm not making gs but
should i just go jg on carousel but then if i hit duel lotus
like du lotus 3 with jg is so bad but i'm not making a gun
blade what kind of food did you want oh oh you're not hungry i'm down for korean barbecue
s oh no it's
terrible i mean i'm leveling next turn so i'm not even going to make econ here like like i i'm losing hedge fun
value but like five mythic is too good but if i lose the around i'm i'll make 80

do i win this round this guy's true load this aran is plus one holy
counter carousel it's i'm back i'm last pick i'm not back i'm last pick
man it's not even gem i'm choat one with hedge fund there's spite
there's spite in gem and the and the spite is on my side like okay like a
high chance i'm probably going to be stuck with okay i mean i don't want zezy rot either i mean
yeah oh
oh i mean okay i mean honestly z is not even that
bad considering i'm i'm like i mean it's it's actually not my my front line sucks
250 health i'm just sitting
here with nothing i mean i can also just i can
also just drop all the mythics and play towards i mean like not probably not i
mean like it's probably strongest just play towards vertical mythic anyway
as l does nothing unless it has all items but i' rather just itemize lilia
nautilus it's a porcelain pivot no you have to invest like three full
items on to ashe but the thing is like i just need front line for this uh this cog cuz i actually have items on cog i
mean this is not even
bad like if i if i five streak with hedge funds like this game is just over i can nine on like i can
nine on 51 and send like 1,000 gold and i'm have nautilus nautilus 2 lilia 2 h
to everything
to uh did you want the same meats uh i'm down for brisket and spicy pork belly
but uh i'll probably just eat later yeah i mean i can just order i wait are you hungry if you're not hungry
i can just order like after
stream they got one shot i got gemmed on i just got gemmed on oh my god
this is the
worst i i don't care don't time in a gs rather
ff it's probably half uh it's half red buff for uh h or
lilia whatever items and then i'm i'm i'm s jg the moment i see i
get cloak
cloak i i could also go tg pron hold
me i also just play five minut can actually play real units i mean no matter what it's dclaw is it always
dclaw yes i mean i'm probably going to remake
chath unless i find h and i can just pr chat 3 i am rich as
and also this comp never wins so honestly i might just i might just four five it like four five just go zero for h so
i can i can hatch aead of tempo so that's 40 gold
he's he's 50 gold with level up holy i'm going
eighth you do have ashe items no i don't like it's not good it's not good oh my like bro like like this ashe unit is not
good it's just not good i mean booom is fine i
think oh it's not that good oh these stats are awful i mean it's not that it's not
radiant refractor what's haresis at is haresis good probably not oh wait it's way better it's not baboom
bullar radiant let me see what radiant refractor is probably in okay it's
fine i mean i don't even want to go tg anymore cuz i'm probably going to go uh the thing i mean no one's upgrading that
40 to level
okay i mean i probably just go jg on carousel if i'm going jg on carousel i have bf tear i mean it's always
shun for a duo
carry yeah no diff like don't worry don't worry it looks like i'm e but just
wait just wait not really i didn't hit du lotus
3 not only did i not hit drw lotus 3 i also didn't hit mythic plus
one so what the did i hit oh wait oh i mean this actually kind of helps me a lot but i need a rod a double nautilus
i that's pretty good i just ch you on bench i'm i'm
probably just going to send it cuz this comp doesn't really work out i kind of want to hold ch though
there's no rod now what i mean there's a red buff that's pretty
good red bu lilio or way but this com doesn't really win out i'm just going to send it
hopefully i can find a way at least find seven mythic and just start bullying the
lobby but honestly if i find nautilus 2 i might just sell ch go that there's no
way way like i actually need ch three what the is this this gu
fortune cash out set two level 9 set
two there's a fortune in the lobby i i wukong too
hello i'll hit ni i'm making a gold who cares i think i'm eighth
oh thank god i got an item all right i mean i'm rolling like 30 40 gold
hopefully i can find the way i like if i don't find h this exact turn i'm eighth i'm actually eighth like
i i need to find this i need to get this ch three like now
hello 30
gold to
be every flower to be seen leave your journey or die i'm not
even playing the right board i'm playing three
heavenly okay why didn't find way so now what what's the game plan
i didn't find a way and my front line is a pile of
oh i found a way i mean the board's not even that bad
i mean this is my board on on 4 six like i mean i if i lose this round i will be mind
blown except like i i need to save as many lives as possible cuz this guy already won the
game this gu hedge fund into new recruit what's his radiant
item i can't see oh tg oh okay
this is going
a i i'm still going to roll down for nico and like you know the the one cost odds on nine right now are 15% which is
actually like not even that unlikely so i wouldn't be surprised if i just find two
choats except this guy already won the game he's two1 fortune tiniest
titan like what is this ah this game ah this piss me off
remover maybe i just hit lilia 3 who knows life never a dull
moment every flower bls to be seen
i mean i can't i actually can't i like i'll go guaranteed eight
a zer two except like maybe i if i if if i
like maybe i i maybe i don't even have the luxury of of waiting four turns and i just have to
just cell board and go for lilia 3 not
really don't do not say it do not say it do not say miss lilia 3 please please
spare me i don't even have enough money to buy it if i wanted
to okay i need three more turns i didn't find a single cho
g this game sucks
with
me stop donkey rolling
lol yeah 14 d
i what what am i saving for i'm coming for
you ch and choa bro there's been a nautilus
every shop like
please okay i mean i fight this guy i'm just de i don't know who the beat him he lost his
streak to who oh maybe this guy oh this guy i mean i
beat this guy the
i'm fighting him i'm me too easy
i mean i think he lost and then he and then that and then he just that was his indicator to just level to 10 and just
send it and then i fight him yay is there a cho gath
no uh i mean blue is fine except not really i mean it's
better than shiv i what did the mana cut off with blue buff
40 i probably scam an auto here and there i mean it's pretty good i have haresis it just goes infinite i i i'm
playing mythic with chogath 2 hedge
fun oh oh bet i'm back not
really and then i i'll remove her onto h 2 if i hit h 2
redemption
nico i mean i'm done to fight the h player honestly this guy is piss weak piss week uh is this guy piss weak
or no i i didn't see honestly he's piss weak i'm pretty sure this guy's piss weak like he's
wukong too way too but like that doesn't matter bron to as well it doesn't matter
i have cho three now my fr is actually good i have uh i have harm assist so this quite doesn't do anything you want
later all right
bet all right i mean top five that's pretty good yay


uh i mean i'm fighting clone maybe there's a clone bug this guy looks strong as cuz the thing is this guy actually can just one shot my
team i mean it killed all the trash so that's good one more cast
no oh wait that did no
damage all right bet this might actually i mean and then and then maybe i just go for nautilus 3 out of nowhere but i mean
like i mean i have to hit this stuff first this guy lost to
who oh to this wait
how i don't even know man like i i'm just i i don't get it cuz when i fight that i'm just getting run over i mean
it's probably just matchup diff like i mean i i actually beat i'm actually stronger than this guy right cuz i have
harm assist like i don't get tickled i'm pretty sure i'm strong you know i might actually win this lobby
should i go for both i lose one gold to hold both sides it's just rng on which side i hit and i
just try to paint is empty without
emp every flow blooms to be seen i mean i'm
50/50 which side which side

all right which side i have your you're cute
today i i like let me see if i lose what the is this he trapped us
in the corner what is this guy even
cooking he he trapped it okay i you know i he just win trated me okay i didn't
hit a side all i'll just paint this
then be my okay i mean if i can win the
round i mean i'm not going to paint this last one until i win the
round or until i lose the round sor right
the last time i need to plant was never
all right and i just go n three basically two

off guys i'm missing three i'm missing three copies why would i take one out of the
pool bro this koga in the corner was getting hit and it just aled 10 times
straight huh oh man there's not the thing
i this is like half
ap great i like bramble i mean honestly i' rather just go for this
item
oh never a d moment please like 19 hp is enough yeah
i mean
probably your my naus didn't cast a single time i
think i'm eight oh wait i i mean i i don't think
i'm a i killed enough for sure there's no way this is not enough save
your bro this haresis is just sitting here spam casted all right
bet but i uh i wouldn't be surprised if i still lose actually no i would be surprised oh and it rolled the
blue buff
i mean that's pretty good oh wait what the what the
hello oh haha bye-bye i mean honestly i'm surprised like i you know like i like
like i'm pretty sure if his his list teapots my my nautilus i can like i can still
lose man 21 fortune tiniest titan okay i'm i mean this guy this guy trolled for
sure like that one that one round he he rolled double ascension he he trapped
his set and then like i mean that's the only reason i can just sit here and and and
and and just and greed my paint otherwise i just going zero every single turn


brother this is one of the worst haircuts i've seen in my life mean no disrespect so please don't ban bro shut
the up but like if i hit aernal winter like don't i just win the game cuz like i'm
pretty sure i'm stable off of like off of that garbage and then i just go 98 arcanist i just went
out wait gold collector oh it's probably because your early game with gold collect like you only take gold collector when you have a really strong
early game and it's really good on kaisa and then kaisa zaia like level 9 cap is super
strong i
think bled jewel insane onra bled
jewel uh i don't even know what are the base stats on
it jew
bro like what is this what's even going
on this company man i don't get it
i know where the trouble is new day new friends sa old
me watch this know where the trouble
is as you
wish am i just playing n this game mulched

i mean i'll allow
it it's probably actually pretty decent again because of the uh also it's items and items are super valuable cuz you
need uh you need items for kindred and you need items for gnar but also it's like probably good again cuz ghostly is fixed i mean it
better be fixed
like it's fixed right and no it is it is like it for sure is cuz i'm pretty sure i got dumpster by by go
earlier if it's not fixed i'm
cuz like you like that's your entire mid game like two four ghostly mid
game oh bet oh okay i mean that's what i like to
see yay in darkness we find ourselves


like i i would i would care about popping like these but the thing is it's like this board is like i'm not like
it's so far away from actually spiking like if i find a kindred i'm kind of
down and like the i think the value of dryad or not dry what is this mulched mulched the value of mulched is that
it's it's strong like you you get stacks even if you lose but i mean you also get more stacks what the okay well i'm
kind of down to rolling cuz like no matter what my board is good of the past or not roll but like i'm kind of down to
like actually pop i mean the glove is probably always going to be hodge so i mean i probably always go tear here
if possible but i would prefer like a titans as well like that's the thing like and then like this one like and
then like this has to be morello or i can't and then i also need a bt like titan hodge bt true b titan hodge
bt i mean hodge for now i mean i i need to kill this glove somehow yeah deal i'm going to win this
fight anyway and like i'm i'm going to ff if i if i don't get a titan so i'm
send the chain yo great turtle thank you thank you
thank you for 10 gi bro we want qss i mean qss is only good when they have list it doesn't do anything really mid game that's like half of your game also
m is better i'm an idiot that's great that's
great i mean this spot like it spat last pick no one wants
it i mean b bow on kindred that's pretty good i just know i'm getting that nor
with bf probably not getting that i mean i kind of want this this item i don't think i'm getting that
either oh a fullmer
okay watch there
like okay like should i should i just pop this and risk it for the biscuit like i there's going to be a bone
here he's level
six do i win this without popping probably right
i'm not stupid the thing is like how do you know like i can only use one bow and how do
you know there's not going to be a bow on like how do you know there's not going to be a bow on
uh on kugs so it's like you kind of want to save it cuz you want to like finish three perfect items this item this combo
is like super item hungry like three at them gnar three atem kindred and then it's just a
forced three n three kindred it's a forced kaisa
monsters are
everywhere i win this y
i mean yeah i five streak while having an anvil on
bench i mean you like time of the game's not
over i have 26
stacks four nars
fate hunts you
today also wait what what are the two cods on on on seven and eight
anyone i mean it's 40 on six 33 on 7
what is it on eight 20 20
oh full bt oh a full titans the
okay okay a full titon bd and then have this to play around
he death is not always the release
i have a three item gnar 2 seconds into the game the game just started

if this is not a top two
i don't even know what to say i okay dryad plus one to healthy i i
don't really care oh too healthy i mean okay honestly i don't even want to roll
no but it's the same thing like i don't i don't want to get into it but
like okay i mean this game's over it is
over this curs for
come cloak i might as well roll like
once fate hunts you today two healthy value or should i just
play another
kindred probably too healthy it's probably fine i feel this cont is not very
good okay the thing is that like i don't even mind rolling a little bit cuz one shen is a huge upgrade like two
ghostly it's not like i'm making 40 here and now i'm kind pair i'm probably just going to roll until i'm k 2 or shen
and then just afk for the rest of the
stage the chase okay
mulch plus alune plus two healthy plus three item gnar 2 oh two anvils all right bet that's what i like to see
thanks oh kindred 2 okay run okay i mean three warden
nothing wrong with
that i can drop
no and here and here
antier oh

okay what
hello it's also it's also alune by the way like buff two cost champs
what a boring game i mean yeah i i would agree i would have to agree like you know what i'll gift five subs i feel bad
this is just this is just sad it's so
boring i mean it is boring
i mean i would prefer uh i would prefer rabadons okay like rabadons arc or
jg well i mean rabon is already gone i mean it's rabon for sure but like like like that's gone like ti or glove
arc allowed
i mean just a
look i mean it's a two healthy value vitality on this is not even bad i
lose like i lose ghostly too ghostly no one
cares i have three item gnar three item kindred true bis well it's not true bis
but it's like it's basically tris it's like tr given like like if if you if like if you like like if if anyone like
i i mean like tris as in like is anyone disappointed with these
items no like it's fine it's stage three i have six components on on both of my on both of
them like it's i mean i don't think it's tris i think tris is titan tian bt and then i think it's blue buff morello rabadons
but i mean like whatever just bas of trus last augment heavy hitters or dryad plus
one and it's a wrap oh an or okay for drad yay i mean honestly it's
not even that good because uh like the the the value
of or on stage three is it gives kindred or gnar an item but the thing is i already have three item kindred and
three item gnar
so it's
like it doesn't it doesn't actually do anything here like or giving gnar a full item or
kindred a full item is like insane i'm not even kidding by the way it's not even that good it's actually not i mean i'm happy to see the or but
like y i guess y
oh before dy doesn't even do anything like it's fake i mean it's like who
cares come close come let me show you
darkness some call me evil shall i prove them
right and one roll your sp take it if you
can take back your
spirit our wills align your journey or die in
mine yeah one roll yeah one more roll yeah one more roll
okay i i don't even want to like no one's making a warmogs i know that for sure like warmogs i'd rather
ff it's half d plus one half uh like redemption half even trap
redemption all right bet good job n
forward
lose
bruiser i mean it's actually not that good cuz i'm i'm i'm i'm my like i'm i'm
too off of i need a z
okay i need to deny three star for cost though but also they they they increase
the out of odds on on uh on two cost on on three and or on seven and eight like there's no way i'm just
staying here rolling on six when i have gnar
three like what is it 30 i i don't know but it's it's also 27% what it's
straight up illegal wait what is it it's 30 it's 33 and then 2027 like
what it's l the same and also i just push levels 4 fre
24 to level um no matter what like i will give 10 subs if i end i'll give 20 subs if i
end the game without kra 3 deal
make it 500 no oh i think i'm getting
list help help help and i'm getting nautil list nautil
listed boards again what what is this guy even okay
nice try oh also four ghost is probably better
than all right even trout is pretty good i will allow redemption okay
there's
also okay well everything is gone i mean i'll allow a cane not a huge
fan of the uh the chain but that's okay set heart this is fine i
guess oh heart is empty without
empathy our wills align
but the thing is that don't i actually want to play kayn here like what is that just
just okay i guess you guys are not getting 20 subs
y oh it's too healthy oh you're right it's
fine i think i lost annie
too actually have max aack it seems like my gnar is still full
hp oh my it's a two healthy diff it's a two healthy diff okay no honestly no
it's not like it's it's not bro i have reaper
in oh i mean that's kind of good
oh banshees veil oh okay
okay keep your journey or die in mine
y h over who i mean i'm not losing warden like i
know for sure i'm not losing
warden like aatrox is not even bruiser it's just it's just 100 hp
but i feel like i mean kindred does way more with reaper than 100 hp worth paint fades life fades bro it's
not even bruiser i don't have rexi in
what keep up
uh oh redemption's really good i will allow that
i'm coming for
you i kind of want redemption on this though honestly should just go double redemption but don't i kind of want to
go for an a zero item like one a zero item surely oh wait oh wait oh wait oh even trout wait what oh sorry
it's actually so unreasonable only strong like this game
like wow wow what the is going on
i don't get
it is guys level 9 zero every turn he already knows i won i just need one as here i just win the game for free drop
down to uh not not four ghostly more legendary units yeah honestly like shen's actually
fine
cuz it's too healthy like aatrox for too healthy is fine
i'm down to just start like buffer painting another unit as well but i don't know i don't know what it
is or i
guess but honestly like i'm i'm definely going to hit or i'm kind of to just leave it at five if i can find the
legendary like i mean this is arcanist and two healthy value but like who the cares man bro i'm not
ending theame with a e on my board
i want to see
everything all right bet this is just a spoonfed
first oh rest 3 is useless cuz it's like like what i ever play uh
would i ever play like would i ever go items for reti
no i kind of just go for a zero items i wouldn't even mind another
redemption but i also wouldn't just mind like wouldn't mind a items like a z a zer 2 is is broken like a zero
with a six
rad okay like six ghostly is
worthless i mean behemoth is fine like aatrox is fine i mean bruiser is not actually that good i mean alawi i have
to play warden unless i want to play like set
two i mean i might just drop aoi and then like i mean two healthy value like when you have four six rot is
useless 100 hp means nothing like udyr too udyr 2 rexi level azir
f i'm at 150
sacks that's actually not that good cuz i i already have my items like do these guys have removers
i guess not like radiant bt is actually good and i just play towards kayn duo like it's
actually good as it has so like how how much shield is it 40% max health
shield unless i mean it's fine i'm
down ready for this i'm selling that for sure i mean it's not actually good for now but it's going to be good
soon okay i can buffer a five cost there's no
way i don't hit king to and i'm going to sell shen for
uder i can also play like set syndra
buffer a five cuz i' rather hates here i'm sacking one regardless too healthy
lux rex high drop drop
dryad i think he's been true zero every single bro this is lame cuz he's going to ff man like he already knows i won so
he's just going to ff man this is the
worst show stacks
170 r our way
am a
ian he's probably just going to ff honestly reveal our way
i never i mean surely i find is empty
without emp oh wait oh i i also need to paint choices oh wait i need to paint
one
more oops banshees triad
archangel redemption oh i didn't even red i okay
on oh man oh know you just i mean there's no way i don't hit an a ear there and i
just paint the last a ear and then and then i sell i sell the stupid ass way and then i mean the game's over i mean it's been over


william
oarai all right let's see how many minutes later all right 20 minutes later
actually the game starts at the game starts at 20:6
yes oh 20 minutes later that's weird 13 o
oh like bro these analysts like oh my lord it's just so unreasonable like i
like like they they like watch this game for a living really

really the
doors this one was difficult i mean agreed thank you loot sub oh my god i
hate loot sub
spirits are calling malite you
out teo wait ashe is
here ashe is 0 plus one
with your spiritual this story is not yet finished
teo yasuo paired i don't have a single darus so
that's fine i mean ever since ever since
ghostly got is like bugged like i don't even want hold any of these a
man really over is so
mid no one prom tomorrow oh i mean i can go i can go
fortune plus one or scoreboard scrapper but honestly in in this galaxy like if it's loot sub like isn't fortune
actually bad like it's actually bad no like isn't scoreboard scarper beyond broken
hello i didn't even see what i didn't even see what it was i wasn't
looking yeah like bro like everyone gets a full artifact like i mean i mean just trust me like just believe me the game
is over this is broken straight up
broken attack

no it's a cane game it's a cane game just trust trust pick up like come on just read
vampiric scepter like i'm i'm pretty sure vampiric scepter might be the worst item in the game like like hands down
let me let me see items or i mean this one is beyond broken like it's not even
close let me see what the worst one is it like you can't cast your
ability like what kind of item makes it so it silences yourself hello
luden's tempest like what even is this man you can't like i i was like oh is this broken and then turns out you
can't even cast your own ability like i mean it's definitely not broken it's for sure not
broken it's like like it's straight up true whis true giga
whiss mask of madness though but that was broken on on troll warlord that
was not balanced you just load in with a mu near like mask of madness and then and then they load in with a they load in with a stout
shield yay like that game was just
awful the the coolest the coolest uh unit in that game was that one like one onear piece of uh
i i don't even remember the name like is it dr dr ranger or some three start dr ranger with massive madness and would
just sit there and shoot arrows it was it was kind of lit i mean i enjoyed it at
least
yay i alone deide my
fate all right just trust me it's a uh it's a duelist game just
trust like a death defiance on on b bear last whisper on on on
trist i know i mean i said kayn game but i'm pretty sure ju just trust me just trust me just
wait just wait

wait i just realized you know what actually sounds really good is vampiric suer on
tristana and you just sit in the corner and you just don't even bother i mean isn't okay honestly isn't the ability actually kind of good you gain okay
never mind it's actually kind of
good did you get connections cuz i'm here to yap about how ridiculous ridiculous that was today that's what i
was saying i was just sitting there like what is going on
here and then people were saying that i was stupid but like i bro like
wait let me make sure no one's playing duelist manaz zay last
whisperer teleport the holder to the mirrored hex on the enemy side after 8 seconds the holder returns
to their a man boring well for me cuz i'm like my unit just die instantly it's
the worse
i don't even know what's going on i just know i have not killed a single unit yet oh my
god i'm tired except not really i'm probably like like how long have i streamed 11
hours i'm pretty sure i can stream for like 24 hours today that is actually light work

wait he even sold his the i mean i mean no
okay it's fine like guy just pray i'm not fighting that guy okay love fight that guy that is
unfortunate my destination is clear it is
unfortunate might lose these y please don't fight them please don't fight them nice story is not yet
finished
oh man i killed nothing i mean i saved to 2 hp i guess all
right it's fine i'm scoreboard scrapping 70 hp scoreboard scrapping

okay it said i need volley 3 voli 3 i just run him over

no one is promised tomorrow tear belt dd annie ashe infinite
gold change yesu
malite this world scoreboard scrapper
i do i okay i mean i could also just go heavenly plus one
here i remember playing ashe probably
not but like like i go heavenly plus one and then if i
hit if i hit heavenly plus one can i just play towards uh kayn like kane's not even that bad
here this thing stx plus one i mean i'm pretty sure titans is actually this if you have a
dd i one who the cares but also like do i really want to play towards kayn when i can just play
score scrapper scrap yard whatever the scoreboard
scrapper on dulist it's probably
broken hero grabbed bag on loot sub i'm already rich as
support cash is actually pretty good i mean it's not this garbage i mean they just buffed it
though like hero grab bag like it no like it doesn't do like okay i hit heavenly plus
one like i like i'm down to say not heavenly plus one yeah like like i i mean i'm kind of down
to see if d is good d
all right duelist deal unstable grants
oh okay kns vou
duelist let me read this grant 200 health and 12% omn vamp to the holder
and allies i mean yeah and then i just go for giga tristana giga uh volar and hey it's looking like a win
out like just wait just wait scoreboard
scrapping like just wait just wait just wait one second just wait one
second wait what okay it's not even that
good wait what wait okay i mean that's pretty good for
me uh belt tear
honestly all right thoughts on just on just slamming the uh okay no like okay yeah like like
isn't redemption actually fine on b bear like like who the cares about him or like should i like i mean like titans like i
mean i mean like what else am i going to do with belt
tear i mean i'm probably just going to go a what's it called item like high isn't just
fine yeah i mean it's not even bad they ner the out of titans and i i don't want to go ster ax
like ster ax nah and i kind of want to go bf sword item if i have last whisper i'm down to just go i but also i'm
pretty sure db is a tris but i mean i mean like oh actually
wait oh i there le in the okay
i don't even mind going like adaptive helm like who the cares by the way i'm going to level and roll here i don't really want to lose anymore i think 57
hp is acceptable oh wait actually wait oh no this is oh this is six duel i don't even have to roll a single time i just win the game four
free yay i'm guaranteed six
streak uh heavenly plus one annie is annie
uh grant to the holder and allies within one so it's three but i mean like le in
too but i' rather le in front
line okay honestly i'll swap it
eventually yasuo garen belt tear bf cloak
holy i might have won i might have won the game for free i'm level 750 57 hp scoreboard
scrapping okay
yeah i think it's over here comes
the okay well now that i have trist like i'm kind of down to level to eight but like at the same
time what is this just dord my
car i mean i get onn vamp

if i i mean 12% on 200
hp oh man but like i can't just be i can't
just be like dead zero the entire game for no
reason but also like i mean if i get sage like 12% on like it's
fun i'm kind of just see level seven my level would be would be for
sage i mean i get a reallyi odds wukong odds also i have leing odds
but then i'm i'm just dead zero for like half the
game darus 2 is actually pretty relevant i just got to sh eco
y i'm going go titon healing with bt i just got infinite gold
honestly what the you forgot bow
the power of a dragon
this all right how do i do this like titans but then if i kill
titans who cares who
cares i mean i mean okay no i'm not going i'm not going bt with with dd i'm not going triple
healing i play around
rudon acceptable oh
man all right acceptable f saved f wait
what bro like come on like i i like do i even want more heal like harmes is actually pretty good like gifts is also
good like what's better gifts i mean the thing is i already have this no i already have scoreboard
scrapper does anyone know what it is like haresis
martyr is it just gifts i mean i i already have healing
like it's fine and then martyr like i'm going to get stage as well i'm not just go g i only have two units on my board
deal here comes the food one roll
wukong okay well now i kind of want to
level like now i can level for wukong
it's sage plus heavenly but i mean i kind of need to uh i kind of want like i
kind of want to just roll and hit use my eco
f bro you stream is lagging really three it's uh it's it's uh 40
it's 30 30 32 i mean the odds are good but like the thing is like it's more so
i'm just going to be dead zero and like do i really want to be dead zero
like not really like it's so expensive to level i
mean in one turn it's 36 like maybe i just level and sit thoughts but like
like honestly like isn't it better to just slow roll on on seven and then just eight on four like like like i just guarantee it like like no matter what i'll survive
cloak noo like this noo makes it so like i mean i kind of want like i'm i'm basically just
guaranteed but i think i think after carousel here i can just level one sit like it's not even
bad now i probably like it definitely makes like different rounds i they did
nerf uh heavenly a little
bit 36 i' i'd be no i'd be 20 gold that's not even a
lot 20 gold

there's an irelia
okay man i like i wouldn't mind bow here like rud is so good but irelia is
irelia ster ax like level and sit or or or just sack
two rounds i mean i'd be at
20 oh wait i can't do math oh wait i be at 30 wait 30 wait 68 minus
30 all right deal i can't do math all right and then i just sit two
rounds i'm still rolling 60 gold i just need five copies total the odds don't even go lower rod cloak

acceptable but i mean there's there's no i was going to level if it was level 20 right like like like sit on 20 but like
sit on 30 is pretty
good i think i leveled and i lost in fact i got dumpstered hey
i mean it's fine okay i mean it's
fine i mean i prefer to win the round i roll to 30 okay never mind i'm send
it i'm going to roll to 10 i don't know if i'm going true zero here do not say i have nico do not say it like i i am
aware i'm aware okay i'm one off of everything
hello hello like what the please okay
it's fine it's
fine wait what's going what's going like wrong with my
internet wait what
hello twitch is acting up it's not you oh
okay i mean it's fine you can't miss 35 two lives one off of
both okay okay here comes the hopefully that natural lease in but i mean there's
no way i'm rolling for l in on on eight when i can just n volle and call it
also if i have sage i probably should just front line it now it's it's just three but also i could just go this back
one i mean hp is actually pretty relevant like 200 hp on these two units my board is actually
insane a taste of the dragon
okay a spat i mean i go heavenly plus one with gun blade or i can go like
rudon i mean i kind wait i just realized i don't have antiheal like if i go if i go
morello heavenly then
hello no you know i don't need anti-heal
that i have tris trana like and then i just play around the i'm not i'm not going heav me plus one three
items okay i'll probably get a f this
game should i kn found my trana as well or is it like
whatever must it be that's oh no it's uh it's loot
sub but like if i go morel then it's like like i would have to go bt tr i think i'd rather ff than
that i feel like like i feel like it's whatever like it doesn't matter oh he in two okay this is batt maybe hold
hold the qiyana because if i find um if i find wukong 2 i can kn out like this or something i
don't something i i i don't think it's that that relevant though hp on that
i'm pretty sure i just went out how many i think it's just
one yeah yeah one which is easter but i feel like is like whatever
i have sage i have gun
blade bro these guys are getting run over fury
what's in at nine i don't know something i don't know i'm probably getting a fond
though uh i don't
know i don't know another irelia duels plus one on carousel i
find a um ad

darius i dord is not that good i' rather play three sage than
dord att speed like sometimes
oh i mean bro like these guys are getting run over so hard i would be mind blown if this is not a first how
must it be scoreboard scrapper g from the
fallen three of them volley three of them trist i'm about to have three of them lease
in sage plus one i'll allow is there anti-heal no is there at le an item
that's not i mean any item is is acceptable okay sage is gone that's fine
like crown guard lease in warmogs lease in okay jg le in crown guard le in jg le
in i'll just go crown guard it's fine hp hp what
wait night umbral wait what
who wait what we can z
too what
this guy's tear 2 augment is a thresh three okay honestly he doesn't even look weak crown guarded thresh three double crown
guard actually i'm pretty sure he's getting run
over all right good a

i mean it looks pretty good to meet i mean i can play three sage what does that do a little bit of extra omn vamp
yay tk3 b 3 except he's level
70 level n holy okay we doesn't have kaisa 2

okay this guy's board sucks i think

okay well hopefully he can't hit three star morello that would suck he's six heavenly for
reaper just try
no one is promised tomorrow
yes mittens oh a turtle winter unending whenever a shield a shield on the holder
breaks okay shut the up that is straight up worthless what is this
shrinks shrinks the holder gring them

i should have just leveled like i mean it's lally free i mean like eternal winter is
eternal winter that's pretty
good hello the dude's dead also this guy's a full item on bench by the way i i think he forgot
what do you want to do
later hello oh bet eternal winter that's what i like to see good job
guys hello nah he won't hit there's not enough for cost in the pool and also the odds are got worse a lot worse there's
there's too many forecasts in the pool back here i'll just put this one back too you got
it on a roll for wukong like what what
does wukong do literally nothing i can level for kics or something like who cares some cr chance he useless
on car i'm always going it him
wait did my vol bear die wait what my my vol bear just
died and over oh it's all
good level forage i mean power of a
dragon so i don't even know find morgana you forgot to
bow oh wait oh level for exalted oh that's pretty good all right this what am i missing ashe and some piece of
unit yeah ashe is
here okay bro like it's not real like i okay i don't know okay how like how did
it die like i mean i probably shouldn't like corner it like this like it was just dying instantly oh we got list oh
well that can't be good yeah okay sorry i mean i probably
should not let it get list for
free okay f bro stop saying f like it's
it's not my internet man i mean a
fawn does that even do anything this fawn
okay the fawn like bro like like like for what man like i'm about to just level it's fine all right wait what do i
need azir or ashe is empty without azir
ashe oh all right bet are made by our choices

this vol bear just dies instant it's
whis i mean it's fine
fine all right bet bro fwn give stats now listen i
could have a third a second item on my irelia 26 duelist i i mean sure like i
can play exalted on nine but like i mean like i mean sure i guess i mean then i can level for like three sage does that
even do anything no like it's a irelia to irelia to
like like what the does the fun do for me nothing

how how many canes do you need to three star
nine how many canes does he have two how many are in the
pool 10 what's 10 minus
28 if there if i can find eight canes if i can find eight canes is eight canes enough
to make three star cane when you need nine canes eight you need nine
canes and there are eight available the bag of candy is
$9 but you only have $8 can you buy this bag of
candy how can that be a position i mean the guy like it he could frontline his carry he'd still win no one's killing
the thresh i i have to sit there and attack this eternal winter for a good 30 seconds bro the fight's already
over it's not like his board's bad he's a zer2 like rakan i mean he's he's not raan 2 but he's entire like a to a zer
two udyr too annie too like i'm supposed to win with my porcelain nautilus
like what porel nautilus
what the does porcel and nautilus do i mean by the time he cast he's like half his hp bar is already gone and i've never seen nautilus cast
twice it's it's straight up impossible the only time i've seen naus cast twice is when he when he's three starred
this world needs hope watch this
bombardment also these games today have been so hard like can i can i just get an easy game for once why are
these game so hard i don't know
i don't
know i go where the trouble is uh
they hts you
today they just nerf the
item oh diamond hands right bet i mean that that works for me bro like bro no
no i don't want to hear it no
no oh man the vegges are back
oh man
i'm me this spot i mean okay the good news is i don't have to play ashe i get to play towards like an ap flex
board and honestly i think i think ap fx is kind of exciting to play and watch nope
this no wait really it is
fun fun fun fun

but i actually got a gig opener so that's good this one's got fire

h like this is like openers like these
like i'm not just guaranteed tto
already it's crazy how people back seats when you are probably 6 lp higher than
them wait what our wills alive okay i mean yeah i
guess bro miss an r3
level five level five making 10 here guaranteed most likely will three
streak diamond hands
shiv these guys are not even bothering
uh to level because they know they can't beat me this board is is too illegal blue on zyra and
teo front line is uh jax 2 warden with garen diamond
hands level five making 10

feels like you're the only mod what a goat rest are not doing
bro this guy is just glazing for no
reason can you show jack item yeah 25 ap 400 health a gold
turn i i prefer rod but
i mean gargo is too good for now but i think diamond hands is in this comp do you diamond hands
silus or you diamond hands gallo it's just silus right you just you just you just put it on on silus and you
call it a day right i mean it's 25 ap like that can't be
bad okay
uh there's jana diana i mean jax is

jx it's not guaranteed is bad i mean s like ser 2 is
bad i don't really care about the teo2 i am that it's too expensiv worlds hope
like let's say there is a team next shop it means it means i break 30
n choice of artifacts i mean talisman just got
nerfed i'm pretty sure like suspicious is actually better now what is this 300
health instead wait if you suspicious with
diamond hands you get four gold with i mean okay i mean it's this
for sure like even even without it like what the i will not what the
it's not even good because wait okay the problem with this okay the problem with this is my
front line is so illegal it's not even going to give me gold half the time oh
my oh like this guy just gives me zero
gold like this does not seem balanced at all but i mean it's not proing half the time if i fight like my board is bro i'm
going straight to nine i am that
good but then also the uh the that split off get uh get
reduced they get reduced uh or they they get the 1.5 second stasis as well or not stasis but like invulnerability that's
actually okay that is broken that is actually
broken okay yeah they uh they just fixed it i mean it was much
needed it was a it was like 400 health and then it would it would like 150% ascension and then it was also ascending
at 18 seconds but now they nerfed it to 22 which is a lot more reasonable it's probably still pretty
good if you have the setup but i think before it was like good even though like even if you didn't have the setup for it
it was it was still too
good a fullmer okay none will escape my grasp
i want to see
everything scoreboard found an an
irer at what hp does this
wait where's my
gold i don't think i got a single gold i don't think i got a single gold
hello i mean bro like they're all above 50% oh no i the first one doesn't work
but i think i think that those three have to work i think i mean they better work or i'm going to be mad
shock treatment you have my bow big grab bag two rolls story
weaver balance budget ldp heroic know your enemy big grab bag i just found a
silus
the of the past
i mean the problem with
this is it's uh you know here i i'll just get slightly weaker and then aggro
toggles onto the gargoyle our wills align
but this works right surely i i got one gold here oh oh i got
a gold again okay this is not balanced like what the is this hello
hello and then like they just run around and just on everyone for free okay
what i want to see
okay get the past it only clouds the future
uh also i'm kind of okay with just
reforging h nah i'm done there just chill also why am i not leveling here it's so cheap i didn't level
here really our will alive i am an
idiot oh one gold here
br s is or not pr's looking at this and he's just like what's going
on es okay
well like it's it's brok it's actually better on salus and udyr because udyr is uh too many autos to cast
all right chain in this lobby is worthless okay i mean should i just
reforge full bramble like ap ap ad and ad n it's not that worthless it's
not good though as you wish
this world needs hope also it was so cheap to level there i don't know why i didn't level alsoo

a 2 i think i'm still down to level though
and we're almost fine or i'm still down to roll
eight like my entire board is is
garbage none will escape my
gras okay
y honestly it's only it's only a two gold diff and like i actually want riven aatrox like honestly it riven aatrox
and that's fine this is necessary
r aatrox zyra is there a better board i can be playing like diana instead
of jana i'll hold on to this for now aatrox

wait he's oh wait this is also good the virtually the martyr suspicious i mean it's not it's not as broken as this
but like it's still really
good it's just sil does so much
damage and his mana is like relatively low
none will escape my
gras come let me show you
i'm not to roll a little bit i'm sitting on so much
garbage so many ways to
spike tire board wants our trash yeah i
am riven to i mean honestly it janet 2 and
i'm done rolling no death is not always a
release also i really should be holding the uh
heaveness okay saka
too done rolling i'm three bruiser i mean that's fine shiv
morello bow belt belt cloak lilia not
playing this i playing jana no

but if i hit s this pa san united is okay
uplink forge i mean san united this com is kind of good really
good this fake my unified is also good though like what's better sand united or
unified it's probably sand right sand i'm i'm about to have like eight traits
and i already have my tanks are actually fine prob will not be a problem jenna
too your command
go level 50 on 42 says level 8 10
wait what he collected my coins oh wait is empty without empathy wait i have a
list i'm dumb some call me evil shall i prove
them right
there's no way this is my strongest like i there's something not right
here there's something not right sorry like there's i don't know i don't know what it is but there's something
not right
goes i need let me just den i three start four cost cuz i'm already guaranteed first
you know what's useless here like this cloak i mean i i i need a tear item like adaptive on on h is way too
good evil shall i prove them right i don't have to worry about zyra for the
rest of the game also like one gallo is a huge spike like honestly okay i'm not
to just slight roll here like one gall was a huge spike i will not hold
back okay one roll i didn't even hit i i just rolled all this gold for nothing
i'm i'm paired on everything hello hello
also like i don't even want to like like i like why the am i hatching zyra like don't worry don't worry like it's a
first like it like it really is a first i wanted to like cy roll here and then and then i just five to it but if that's
my plan i should have just i should have just sent it and committed like there's no reason to not commit also what the
is this do i even beat this
okay i'm pretty sure i need to play list on my board but list just got nerfed so it's not even that good like what the
you're into the dark okay i'm pretty sure i have to play list on board like
there's actually no way i can get away without it the power of a
dragon i mean it's it's fine like like what the is
that i i don't even think i outa
that he's wrath of the moon as well
ascension yeah maybe triple l like like trench coat l against him like i play syus and then i mean that means i need
to save hp like syus like silus against everyone else when it's just us two in the lobby then i'll just swap to
list and then that's my wion i i this guy's board is i don't know if i'm winning
regardless what the what the okay
i'm roll 40 gold here i have a paint in two
turns i mean i don't i don't lose anyone else i should wait i think i l anyone
else none will escape my
gr no place is safe while i'm
free let me show you
darkness let's move i've got people to expire stick to the plan we have a
plan honestly is without i mean no one cares about
this like it's always lukong
eventually but i need uh i'm pretty sure i actually drop like i'm dropping i'm dropping the
four bruers like morgana's gone as well and i can drop that for a max
cap also i could just paint syus
four bruiser is like not that useful but but then i would be
dropping honestly the wa like like nah like it i'm just going to go silus guaranteed two lies it's always going to
be me against what is this i mean i can go ap hp ap or hp ap
whole boards ap
nice i painted nothing i wasted my paint
okay also i mean i'm i'm down to get rid of like morgana for
wukong i mean it's morgana
too but i mean it's morgana too also i just i painted my silus oh my and then also the uh what's
it called is useless like the aatrox
plus like i can i can lose
this like gallo
plusy remind of like gallo plus aatrox for for diana plus one is that even
worth you think look what you made me or or gallo like gallo aatrox for i mean
i lose the problem is i lo and then i can also just drop zyra if i'm dropping gallo gallo
aatrox zyra like for i the spirits i feel
closest
too my like one i mean rakan is rakan
i'm probably done rolling for now i mean like i know four bruiser
sucks cuz i can also just drop this like like drop like i dropped the three bruiser i honestly i just dropped
this and this for diana plus wukong deal okay done four bruiser it's like sw is actually good
gall 2 is g
2 also the sil should probably solo front line considering he's tanky as
save
your i mean this guy i don't i don't know if i'm being this guy though like
i should just focus on this board maybe i can make sil
three except okay never mind okay i'm pretty sure i i can't even beat that
ever okay man is lame
stick to the plan we have a plan i can drop this plus this for diana
plus wukong but it has to be it has to be like two
stars but uh i'm just going to i'm just going to
paint until 5 and then i'm going send it but also like against this guy like
don't i need to swap to list i just dro stus for list okay yeah okay i play this board and i just dro stus for list on
after it's one v one beautiful baby this reminds of our
first got my entire board cered by my time word i mean white
undeniable light
up okay also why is this not solo front light is a real question

okay great there's no m being in this guy i don't even if i beat this guy
actually okay i'm pretty sure if i trench coat list i beat this guy for sure actually you know what maybe i don't even need the list cuz this this
yor is kind of dying wait this yor got on wait
what okay never
mind wait what i mean they nerfed it but like still like i mean his board looks kind
of good i thought it was
i can also just try to level for i mean wukong and then i just drop like
level for wukong and then i just play diana and then i don't i don't even have to play this like maybe that also wins as well cuz it's not like aatrox is
bad like it's not like four bruiser is terrible like i'm going to have gallo 2 i mean rakan 2 is i mean i'm definitely
going to roll until one of these are upgraded though yeah
yeah beautiful baby i am awakened
you forgot to bow some call me evil shall i prove them
right you forgot to bow this is necess
hello never
hello hello okay i guess i'm not leveling this game wukong
paired my i i don't even know which one i want to hatch
i mean i probably just i probably just hatch
rakan i mean wukong 2 is actually
good so this not going item for a while ka i think he's dead is he
dead no

oh okay well hopefully he doesn't k 3 that that'd be
unfortunate i mean he just sent it unless that's 50 but i doubt it like maybe i just hit gall
3 i mean wukong's a huge upgrade i mean i can also play wukong
over this this not really i mean i can play wukong too over over like aatrox it doesn't even matter i can also play like
it over this but not really i mean i can also just level i can also just go for gallo 3 i think he's two off of kayn 3
now or wait is he no maybe i'm stressing for no reason like
i'm i'm still stronger
i are you over there what do you want to do
lateral okay this this seems to be sol front line though because i'd rather have this split
asap spirited away
well that was satisfying

this i le ex i to
i mean my morgana i think just solo doesn't oh no it
didn't oh no help help help i mean it's fine ian that guy died
i mean i'm pretty sure that was a fluke this porcelain plus one
i don't even know what he wants i mean i don't even know what i
want whatever five y ono
two i mean like i i'm pretty sure i have enough money to level next turn for wukong and there's no way i lose yeah also i should just pain the three
cost uh okay also this matchup
like this
middle oh no
help it's okay it's
okay like it's actually not likely that he hits like it's actually
not are you having fun over there l with
me this reminds me of our
first all right bet


man it's wild my 4-year-old has a more sophisticated vocabulary than this tft streamer bro i'd clear your
four-year-old relax buddy yo when he grows up yo send him send him to play tft against me oh wait he can't he's
going to be hard stuck fuing gold like yourself like relax wait
what uh okay honestly i'm kind of down for a gold sub like a gold sub practice because the thing is i'm pretty sure
like i like i'm like sitting there trying to econ to 9 but on gold sub it's correct to just literally just go zero
every turn on eight because how do you know they don't just give you 50 gold on next next
thingy wa where is this okay hold
on uh
announcement overlay
where where do you even find the overlay i don't get it maybe it's in my email

i forgot b was even a unit this story is not yet
finished oh i can come closer
come closer i'm going hat z to for bre story is not yet finished maybe i
play some silus this game i learn how to play stus uh to download
link overall rule
set oh belt
what the are these options this is not acceptable ego raid wait
what wait emily you ended stream uh right before the the tournament damn
that's weird yo yo thank you thank you thank you for the ra
though bro like i don't want any of these can i just leave all right it hedge fun fast time
like i don't even like birthday present my board like is like is fine like all right it h one fast
n i got hatch of zyro that's pretty good come
closer they call me and if i'm going hun fast like i just
go shi slam it's fine and then belt i'm fighting an eternal winter this guy like reforge one item eternal winter oh my
god this game is so
suck you new friends sa old
me oh okay i mean that's acceptable not even a loss
i see to have gotten wider again i mean this game is over
holy this opener okay i i don't even know what to say this like
what i hate hedge fund on 21 but i i think it's acceptable if uh i'm going to get some water i think it's
acceptable if uh if you have a zyro 2 2 seconds of
clear none will escape my gras
wait i won i thought i fought level
five i won
that wait what the how did i win that
was it
close oh yeah z's pretty broken like zyra
too like honestly like i i wouldn't even mind losing that one cuz the thing is um
actually if all three of these win oh wait i lost wait what i lost bro it's a belt di oh my god
also i should be holding this garen pair sorry i mean it's fine did i g pick yeah i did nice it's fine like the the one
econ that you get from winning is like
irrelevant cu of uh what's it
called uh i have hedge fund like i'm going straight to 40 and straight to 50 and straight to 60
answer yeah full rabbit on sh rabbit
on holy i think i'm going another
first never mind i need the econ or i can't level oh my
god bro like if i won the round and then i level and i win this round like don't like i mean i can't level like like i
would level here if if if i were capped at 50 but if i'm capped at 100 like this one level is worth like 7
million gold but like like in leveling for this recti is is actually pretty good it's actually a huge
spike also leveling for a mo was also a huge
spike but like you lose every interval so it's not it's not really
worth i'm just going to hold on to the uh rec side cuz it's paired wait actually does kobuko gain
hp like like more hp if you have hedge
fund oh wait this guy's about to have like 5k hp then i give him a redemption he's like he's basically a
two star like okay but like i mean i have to level here like it's too big of a spike man like it's a rex high 2 kayn
starter kit kayn i mean it's a reite too oh my god i mean it's also there's
also allawi okay it's fine cuz i have to hold this allawi like anyway it's next
in unless this is already stronger yeah like
too but also like is isn't it like is it making econ with hed fun like fake
because the thing is like if if you can just like like this this augment okay it's not fake but what i'm
saying is like no matter how like even if you greed a five loss and you have every econ interval known to man
you're still not going to be able to for five it it's it's if you four five it you're down a prismatic but like you
have the econ like if you five if you can make it to 51 like if you can survive until 51 you're rolling like
150 gold on 51 but if you if you if you 4 five it like you're only
rolling like 50 gold and like is that really worth you being down a prismatic the entire game just to roll 50 gold two turns ahead of time like not
really i have fortune but like isn't my bo kind of good like really
good oh wait i i just realized i'm hatching some i think oh i'm hatching a zoe i'm zoe what's your name
zoe to like it make 60
i'm zoe what's your name i want to see everything make 60
make 70 stock one make 70 make 70
again should i just go one last whisper and build like a
ad i could also just go like guard breer and play around i mean like i kind of like last sister play around belt
though yay yay

like tiniest titan i get fortune and then i just go fast 10
well now i need to roll until until fortune

okay i me honestly if it rolls one here i don't really mind losing like it looks like my board is good
like it looks like my board is good but it's not actually good i don't have a single prismatic

bro like you should have make it that easy like a one unit loss down double prismatic the
okay it's looking a little too easy but
also i'm getting a little worried because like i'm looking at my board it doesn't even look bad i mean i'm going to lose this he's
tiny bit deadly with with the thingy this guy has like 17 items i'm going to lose that this guy has like 16 items
okay well i'm probably losing both of these but also like i i'm pretty sure i can't even go nine like i like i have to
go fast 10 here like like tiniest titan even a fortune cash out isn't saving
hedge fun tiniest titan
i mean i wanted the rod
but i'll settle with an or or with glove just start start building the

tgs it's actually pretty
good bro what stop rolling ones man
i mean i i mean it's fine honestly it's fine it's just free it's just
free i roll the triple
one okay i mean i'm not winning a single round my board actually looks good but i'm just down too many
prismatics is a triple i can hatch as silus as
well i want to what do i even want to hatch
here probably annie
uh i mean i'm probably going to cash out like it's not worth
it okay i need i need a tristana right any
tristana i six is good and then i just 51 level i i just go straight to 10 on 51 i this game's over it's it's for sure
over i'm 10 on 51
ah
stand back big strong n coming through
oh
yes good job everyone trana try to keep
up forget the past it only clouds the future
like this part isn't too strong right like i'm not stupid like there like i i don't have a
single combat i just want that be to be clear like i don't have like nothing i don't have a single combat
arugment yeah like if i if i lose if i win around here i'm going to report like whoever the i beat like
they'll just get straight up reported
like i i'm i haven't roll like i'm just sitting here playing no synergy i have story weaver and bruiser that's
it okay yeah okay that that's fair acceptable
acceptable i mean lucky gloves is like relatively low cap actually oh j lus
three okay i mean do i just win the game
then lotus
three yeah let me just uh make sure people
don't hit three star for costs

try are you having fun over there
even a loss not
really time i had to pl was
never i go where the trouble is
can also go last whisper

should i start should i start going uh tgs i'm
down level 10
tgs last wher and then a bf item like i can do a car
zia bro i'm not about to die man like i like 32 hp i'm 34 cuz i heal two from
tinest titan i started the fight i'm 36 like i'm pretty sure i cash out i'm still three lives i the spirits i feel
closest or two lives maybe not maybe not not three or like one life but like i'll
probably heal up to two

okay after this loss i'm not convinced i'm going to be two lies i'm pretty sure it's a one life but that's okay 75 charge let me uh let me just say which
ones i want
beforehand actually like i don't make 95 right like there's no way no i don't i'm coming for you
i mean this one's fine fine okay this one's not that good cuz like i like i don't have enough time and then this one's fine like i mean it's probably an
instant win just don't give me the nios like like you can't just go for three start like you can't like this riot games company they expect you in
one turn to just start rolling for one three star for cost without even stabilizing your board like like that
that cash out is just straight up like reportable also i'm down to lose some
hedge fund value so i can actually roll if i actually have the money to which i probably
will wait oh i thought i was about to win wait i'm two lives what the i'm 16
hp the
cuz i also need to figure out my cou out
i lose like five gold i'm just going to def in before
these guys start bitching i got the two golden
nios to be seen great r our way great cash
out i mean okay honestly i probably still won it's fine that's enough rolling for now
final sight paint fades life fades strength of
spirit i chel the spirit i feel closest heart is empty without
empathy legends are told in word and deed
fate is in our hands oh oh okay it's fine it's
fine i there's no way i die here
yeah that beautiful baby i'm one off
over 16 hp my board is not even bad
legends are told in word
and be my can
heart is empty without empathy be
my heaveness
yay i held the greatest blessing
i have your back you're cute
today all right
bet it's kind of lame that it doesn't even print instantly uh i should probably try to get mythic for this guy it's a three
star i have a kuku on my board but this guy is so much hp that it's like
lowkey fine no prison can hold
me
he come let me show you darkness like
sure i'm just going to print a three cost or
wait it paints two stars wait really legs are
told so if i paint if i paint an uder it gives me uder 3 paint fades life
fades not anymore oh a
man wait yes it does not no
yes i mean i might as well just like i mean i can paint i can paint a regular rier like it's
fine wait read it it doesn't say anything okay i mean like surely i get
myth again word and deed like i'm not trying to load in with
nothing let's move i've got oh read the trait
oh i don't i don't think so

your here you win wi
last time i had pl was never all right you know what like like the mythic like like i i i cannot not playing the
unit like honestly like i don't even paint here so then i i like that way i can
paint the last here cuz that that shit's actually impossible to find there's only nine
copies listen there's only nine copies guys there's only nine copies like why don't i find the one of the two
why don't i find one of the two this gu just left why don't i find one of the two and then i paint in the
turn oh yeah like why not how about
that like bro i'm not losing with way 3
like like i get it on one life but like you think i'm losing with way3 really

we are made by our choices fate is in our hands

i can also just buffer the anvil but like honestly i don't even think there's value in that i am that good oh wait oh
wait oh i can just hatch the ear oh i forgot it was this
thing i honestly i can just reforge the tg or i can just play for like the the giga
first and just bench this one for a turn and then that way like when it paints it like it guarantees hatch the the other
one bro like i like i i don't need like there's no way like i like yeah i mean there's no way like it's fine
like that way like that way i can bounce the tg and keep the tg like if i die here with ho 3 that's a balancing issue
agreed that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first
days feel good anyone else want to try
darling all right bet of spirit

cell board okay okay all right it it i i'll just bench this for a turn i kind of want to see what we

does what do you want to do later wait what the wait what

ready for this all i know is i have a
silus and a g on my board

my height oh man i am living change

t no but honestly today i'm locked in you're actually not going to see a single b for today
honestly i just hard for an aos game
accomplice i actually really like living forge though i think i mean i think
wanding trainer is like not that good from this spot let me let me make sure though gm plus you know i'll just go by stats
it i i think accomp is pretty good though 4.17 wandering trainer is a 4 point
63 and living forge 4.7 really
okay i don't even know why though i feel like it's not even

bad uh honestly thought the still okay
honestly i i i feel like okay never mind accom gloves is broken like the thing is doesn't living forge out scale
accomplice gloves like starting like stage six like i i feel like i would take this
and four gold like four gold early game and then like it it's probably
still slightly better cuz you you already got four gold and then like starting stage six the the living forge might be better like nice
starting stage six who the cares also ice cream cone oh
no this is the worst
find honestly like it i just i just quadruple level
here all right i'm just going to ditch
the jax how much ourselves never a d
moment soi seeing stage six emily do you even sleep you're a full-time hater you know also you tweeted some
stupid ass and i i liked it but i regret like liking it i liked it and
then i was going to comment and harass you on twitter but then what happened was i was like you know what i'm actually not going to do that
and then now it it just makes me look stupid cuz i just like your stupid ass tweet
but
anyways which one oh there's more there's more dumb tweets oh maybe i don't
know all right it i just double level here
it fate hunts you today
oh man i feel this is not even worth it i mean it probably is worth
it all bet i mean it's looking really
good it's looking amazing actually
like from this spot even i can't mess up this spot no like is this is this spot even mess
up aable really i mean i'm rich because i i
just the game the comp just or this just gives me four gold i'm up four gold already like this spot is just looking
it's looking a little too good
this accomplish glov is is not very balanced i watched you all last night aage what you average in the tney today
oh wait you didn't make it to day three again really
damn wait what didn't even look at the lobby can't judge the spot

slow too soon oh sorry i mean i take it back yo did you qualify for day
three i don't know i i i don't know i was i don't know
maybe yeah whatever oh you made it to day three oh
did you qualify for day four where the non- mickey mousers play i mean surely a player of your caliber i would say is a
non- mickey mouser like surely you made
it wait what bro what the is
this okay i have a question how can they just call down
component animals to sumone with a trash to treasure anyone know does anyone know
like no serious question like anyone know or or n i mean it's just so crazy i just
load in against the avengers like whole crusher whole crusher eternal
winter okay it's okay i mean
okay this one's got fire i mean i'd rather put this on a
frontliner or like someone that can potentially be front lined but like honestly i mean kindred can hiy potentially be front lined it's fine uh
banshees veil buffing i mean i could go yeah i should probably
just give attack speed it's fine i'll just buff these
two i mean if i lose this round it's fine i'll just buy
aos i can't even see his vard
okay but honestly i don't really care about the fix that much i just kind of want to just set up before too sp 20
work for me man this guy seems so happy 10
minutes in he don't know what going to happened 8 hours later
aware the thing is like how can you use all of these twitch like all like this like okay the thing is if you
use a wear right this like this guy has to be just like a dedicated hate watcher cuz the
thing is there's nothing wrong with like if if english is your second language i'm not i'm not like i'm not going off
on you because because but it's clear that english is not your first language but the thing is you're still
so i don't even know what the word is it's so how how do you just use a wear
perfectly like i like what bro trying as hard as not to be
wait really like you're just yeah like you're just is so literate in in twitch chat
like whatever he's just a fulltime hater i guess it's all good won't spoil the
chase
y all right zeke's ice cream
cone it's 12 to level i can level for uh a gnar which is actually a pretty big
upgrade it's also free dryad i honestly i still make 30 but then i can't really
sell this thresh you know what like it doesn't really matter if i lose this
fight ah i'm kind of down cuz the thing is i make 40 i make 40 when like usually i would level and i have to sell rush to
make 30 and like how do you know i don't just fight someone piss weak
okay and now my game's just set up i just 4 two you can't even throw this spots
two zonas bro he's trash treasures two unfortun i already won the game the
okay i guess he just wins four fre and i
lost wait he
wait he up somewhere his reforger is gone man
okay this guy is a certified clown like there's there's just no
way
okay what i get something good oh locket zekes i'll allow that our
bet honestly ly i might actually just lock it my front line as well cuz i do have these snipers in the
back

yeah all right it's uh thresh ashe plus one
oh wait what the my feel wait what the i mean all allow
that what my aelius it wasn't even the kindred my aus just walked right behind
the kindred and just and okay and just okay
in darkness we find
ourselves i i can go random or i can go lock i rather just go lock and place the thing also i'm looking at this i get me the out trickers glass
uh mana mazan
dfg okay it was dfg on this probably i mean actually it's fine and have a chain
vest i mean from this spot it's looking a little too good also
does this even work i guess i guess it does but it
doesn't look very good

it's just so boring this p is looking a little too
good i see the lebron
resemblance yeah maybe
it say's title a lie or actually trying to win what do you think
you are the zeta division bundle of tft what i'm what's your name i mean is
that bad i i mean i'm guessing it's pretty bad like wait what
what is the thing again it's tattoo protection right i kind of want to hold this
then is there any way i can play like i mean then i
would i mean i will allow this spot okay never mind what the is this vol bear vol
2 or yoro 2 like bro
what okay looks like i level than i
lost i mean it's fine like i like i'm i'm still making 30 and like my i'm i'm actually kind of rich cuz the thing is
like my bench like no matter what i can make 40 next round like it's fine the is
this it's not a big deal but i mean my board's actually kind
of good wow that is good that is good actually wait what
my chanel the spirits i feel closest to another
zeks i mean tattoo of protection and then now i can just play senna i i can i
can i can just play jack i'm final board like hold this garbage i mean might playing this garbage probably not two
nautilus on bench i have a free tattoo okay i'm trolling
i'm not double zing my affiliat this can't be right like what the
wait am i double zing it no i don't think no i'm
not oh my god yeah not proba tr i
add not probably like it is better d also like like why am i not double zing
my also this cleaver item i rolled is kind of
good and light yes in darkness we find
ourselves okay now what also i can play like thresh over
kindred but the thing is h i'll just okay it's fine h okay it's fine
okay okay i'm two out3 exalted
somehow a moment of silence syndra i will not bow tear rod
what i roll rand wins i mean honestly i mean i could also
go guinsoo and play around cuz i'm probably going to getu i mean do i even want to getu the
ashe i honestly i might just commit all three of these items onto ashe and i just go shiv and or archangel and play a duo
carry i mean i like shiv more actually and that way i can just play a du carry and not feel like i'm just throwing my
game uh shiv and then play around rod to and then just put like i mean i have zeks plus the thing like whatever shiv
plus rod i have syndra here i can drop a fos or this for ashe am i just not
playing uh honestly no what's it called it's fine yeah no
porcelain like who cares about porcelain i'm down to just
play i i probably am playing ink shadow cuz i found ud
early i i'll see what i hit cuz sometimes you just hit like list for free but i don't even know if i'm
playing towards a mumu here i feel like ink shadow is probably better
all right golden egg game it like if there's one game it's golden
egg it's this game yeah it
oh oops what did it roll again zephyr zephyr
banshees and then i'm probably going to
pair all right bet
i mean it's looking pretty good no just upgrade everything if i can win
this round like scam a around on my on the
egg oh it's looking good it's looking really good and that's already one out
of whatever it is like i have exalted here like i can
play exalted instead of uh amumu necessary but i mean amumu 2 is aumu too
and then this is the free thingy honestly exalt is probably better
than aum to like what is this a wait actually do i i have warden yeah oh yeah i do it's not like i have ashe not just
make econ and is
oh is what's it called better you think
is syndra one better than ri2 i mean maybe this guy's ashe to by the
way i think i just won another round all right gg's you know what they say you
win two rounds on stage four with golden egg you're guaranteed to cash out you
know what they say is freedom
they say that i mean i say that i mean i am guaranteed to cash out
no bro i took golden egg and i i i i won two rounds i mean i just hit nautilus 2
aphelios 2 for free that's pretty good it's really good i mean yeah it is
good the thing is syndra 2 is actually a huge upgrade and i don't think there's a single syndra gone like honestly if i just
roll here i'm probably just guaranteed to hit syndra too and even if i don't like it's fine cuz my cash out is is going to be
the thingy to be seen
in darkness we find ourselves al i just realized i mean i could remake
this such power ice cream
cone also i didn't i didn't ni it oops
sorry my bad or actually i i could have actually moved this onto like
and there oh no kayn
too hello i mean bro like come on wait wait
wait oh no no no he won all three please can someone stop his who is
letting this guy get wins with that this is a nio diff who is letting
this such potential who is letting this guy get free rounds man
who oh my god what the
how does this guy just get free rounds i don't know deny me no
longer what the

all i know is i'm playing aphelios carry but like there's no way i lose to this yeah he's playing kayn one
carry his stupid ass list threw the nautilus back onto my tank oh my like
okay but the thing is this guy's also cash oh nice he got 30 oh yeah this guy all right
good okay i mean okay but like even if you don't agree what with what i say you
know what they say
you know what they say like if you win three rounds you're b it's basically just
locked i mean it is 80 hp and neutrals count so it's like three off like like
what like it is
locked also i should probably just pair these two like it's my front line actually fine
solid war up who's next uh i probably will cap on or
eventually who's the behemoth right now stupid ass thresh i mean even three behemoth is fine
yeah a full tge i'll allow
that ice cream banshees
honestly i'd rather just front line it also i should probably just pair these two
now i've r the worst items known to man i honestly the or like i can make 30 but
it's not like it makes 40 i'm probably ending the game with senna here beautiy remind of our i don't
even know if i'm going here it's probably just going to be uh ashe
over aphelios and then i just play set i mean i also don't have to play
ink but we'll see like it five exalted game ashe
plus alon
maybe component or gold i mean i am camping
around watch this but i probably will always end with ink right okay also some of these catch ups
are not good there's like one catch up that gives like triforce it gives no fawn it gives like a spirit vis
or triforce and some other trash like if i get that one i'm going to start complaining is that
fair monsters are everywhere like that one is just like what even is that
okay here i'm pretty sure since i have gem i should just pair the
thresh like you'll know when you see it like there's no fawn i think it's the only one with no
fawn tear it's like no fawn you'll see it you you'll know when
you see it just trust me you're going to be like what the is is this or maybe you're not going to be
like that but i'm going to be like
that okay it has to have one two golden
eos moners are everywhere i mean i can just go for a three star this game for
sure i just i just sack i mean this one's not that good most of
the time but i'm so
healthy let me see how this guy's doing not good i hope oh he's about to catch out
though oh on oh uh
the thing is like this this doesn't actually i mean it's fine cuz i'm so healthy so i don't really mind sacking but like this one's not that good
either cuz it doesn't it like after you cash out it doesn't like perf it doesn't just spike your board immediately and
unless you have to keep rolling but then like sometimes it's like yeah i i'm not saying it's bad like it's
fine
like for my spot it was fine set with bt like way and i just start
hatching oh i have a red buff and umal plus one
okay sure
all right two turns is perfect interal i might as well just st to en roll n odds 20% crit
chance i'm not even going to bother doing the
thing what do you get you got a radiant
item i mean it's fine i'm about to load with the three star for cost yeah
i have your yeah i can five exed it's a ashover aphelios and i play the stupid ass
aon yeah three here i'm down like don't don't worry i'm i'm just sacking too don't worry don't worry
this one's got
fire do not
worry uh let me see what people can
deny oh i'm not stupid right there's not
a single ud gone
to the spirits reveal our way leave your
dream or die in mine some i mean i'm not going for this
i held the greatest
blessing okay so where's the stuff i is the board
reveal our way so where where's my stuff no fate is
written except by us i mean i basically have guaranteed n
3 but no one wants to play n 3
man like that shit's just too boring my expence i feel closest
to we must press on
last time i ate a pl it was
never i mean it's fine i still have another one it's fine i have another one it's fine like it guarantees me to survive like it's fine it's fine
baby this reminds me of our oh
man i mean it's not terrible like it's fine like it's not aer 3
but i mean yay wish my f on anybody all right how do i
play this what is this useless for me i'm playing okay there's no way okay
i'm playing five umbral when i could be playing two other units no i'm playing this diana plus what that's worthless
like these two then i when i can be playing list plus one like another warden or no is another warden even
better what are the wardens allawi the thing is l is also arcanist
though l plus oh no thresh is exalted though and
it's free but heat that's pretty good y
oh man this is the worst

i mean i get more gold like this yeah there's one more round there's one more round don't
worry i think oh actually oh i'm sorry i think i
won oh man i think i won
i'm sorry bro come on i mean at least i took the egg man like


all right please not the least in three please like okay if i fight this guy it's actually a top four yes everyone
agree i beat this guy with nothing man and then like come on come on come on come on please please please like 50/50
come on 50/50 please
okay you think i fought
him please
oh please that was beautiful baby he has a
radiant bt man like come on please like it's a 50 okay okay come on
this is not a fifth this is not a fifth you cannot tell me this is a sixth day three sets and the only reason
it's getting closer is cuz there's like there's like there's only there's almost only na players and like if there's like
let's say there's a lobby of eight any players there has to be a any player that goes
a it don't even get me started on ema at worlds they're approaching the
fives solid warm up who's
next wait what i'm not at the fives
4.6 that's pretty good watch
this okay i'm pretty sure in this anvil like everyone's going to hard force ashe but honestly it's fine ashe is kind
of fun like if you pop this and get and get bows
solid war who's
next bow fight yasuo story is not yet
finished civer
lux i would have to sell like shen bro like isn't my board kind of
close to being good like chogath pair you can't miss everything man chogath
pair jack
pair yeah like i'm not holding lu you oh caretaker's ally is kind of
fun i didn't hit a single unit oh i got set up h okay i mean it works for me
no shadow without
light oh but i probably won't roll like i'm kind of down to just push nine and maybe i play four sniper with c 3 duo
yeah allowed ooh
o like four snipers sent a three trio or like i i just go fast nine and that way
i don't have to cap around the stupid ass ghostly it is tto bombardment so i'll probably play like honestly isn't it just two sniper with
uh l l azir sen trio yeah oh bet not finished looks like
i won the game it's just so boring man i win for
free again all right so what's the board going to be it's going to be
senna uder
at rox like syus is actually pretty
decent i will allow syus ashe i will
allow or
allowed l
allowed acceptable as you know what to aatrox and asus
irelia
to like this holds my ap items or i can just go with zer plus one i mean it
doesn't matter like like no matter why i know i'm not cing around ghostly no one's playing that trash not trying to lose for
free uh until used honestly if i win this next round
i'm down to level and roll a little bit like just roll on five odds it's not even that
bad i think i only need let's say i'm level eight yeah four
i only need two senas and i have sena three two
this guy is so strong riven to oh great i
lost all right it's fine i'll just save my ro for six on
wait no oh i only need one and if i'm level
eight i'm center three so like when i'm level eight like center three is basically the same thing as ash2 so all
i have to do is upgrade some front line units i'm level 9 that's pretty good
jax two v bear bombardment belt
tear i'm trying to kill this tear asap
though but at the same time
like i mean yeah like i'm not making sunfire and then also morello so so far
away and nah like whatever i'm not it's not like i'm protecting this
streak does bombard give as oh what the bro bombardment gives as and ad is
this side i'm just straight up broken 25 as 25 ad last is what bro it's
a 50 as unit is actually kind of good and especially on a three star i mean i'm one c off a cent of three no joke
just i'm actually went off oh sniper sniper yeah
sniper bro this game man bruisers i mean bruisers gets me an
aatrox but also i feel like your component matters
right i mean behemoth it probably gives me
like i'll just take behem this it's fine what i

get okay
it's too good not to make but it's fine one sp the
game i want to i probably just do carry way orer this game there's no way there's no way i'm playing morgana on my board ch
three like it's fine these are not even real
losses like a ho orer doesn't matter and then i have a plus one but i can also play like h saw
this chs from mid
game oh i might just do a care this game okay i mean gs is fine i can also
against a ro kln never a dull
moment come let me show you darkness i mean i don't i don't really
like i actually really like i feel like lilia is actually broken but is there any way i can play lilia with mythic

like it would have to be lilia with way but then like they use the same item so it's like you don't really
want there's no way i'm playing cogma also i'm down to not make econ here actually isn't my ne just
sen is ldp any good ldp s three i mean best is too
good let me just make sure there's a lot of what the
what yeah it's really
good nice comat no shadow
without i'm not even going to bother rolling right now though
like blue buff wait lowkey
archangel cuz if i go blue buff i'm basically committed to to
lilia hold the i know but but i mean i'd rather play ashe list i'm not going to play mythic just to what coga no
thanks like blue buff list is not even that bad
i mean it's
fine okay i have set a three the moment i wanted we find ourselves so should i just okay honestly though but i can also
hit like i can hit 7 3 one turn then and also like i like it's not like i'm rolling on i mean actually no i i will
roll on eight and honestly i'm on three loss like who cares let me roll once it oh annie
keep up all right well this game's over then gg's and just like that the game's over
it's actually over nice and then i go tear belt
and i'll probably actually go redemption first and just put on ti rod i mean t rod's actually good
though like way are both good list is
good ashe i'm i'm last pick really it's gone
okay i could go spark
protect yourself on a giga unit it's kind of good
okay wait what am i missing
something okay i have like tris and then i have tris bench as well my item economy this game
hp armor mr shield armor faster cast three item senna and
then the two item duo carry in h or air and i'm like on on four two i'm just c
of three you think i have to roll a single time okay honestly i probably will use my free roll on eight because i kind of need to upgrade my front line or
like i need like i like i'm i you have to hit something yeah
are the hate watchers still
here holy 4.5 he's locked
in this is necessary
as you wish i want to see

everything h this is the one guy that i i'm worried that it might wrap around to the
cage mind 5050 this anti unit is so good
bye-bye y
as you wish i i can also just c around uh who
cares man you have to hit something it'll be obvious what i'm going to play i don't even know why i care so
much it's actually just too obvious what i'm going to play like you see the good stuff you'll
buy it you can't miss
darkness and light i got a worthless ass oh wait center three
that's pretty good no shadow without but i got a worthless ass blacksmith
gloves like come on this guy gets a support item anvil like this riot games company for
some reason they just think golden nico in and and blacksmith gloves are worth 3,000 times the amount of gold it
actually is it's worth nothing it's worth nothing it's garbage it's a straight up garbage hot
garbage okay get the past it great it r trickers
glass now what like oh my i i was too busy bitching
man oh my god wa oh two
gold y okay that's pretty
good why does he have a cver three yeah i have no idea wait
what that is good for me plus two i'm just using my free rolls
here wouldn't wish my f on anybody wait art is empty without
empathy invoker dord ink shadow
bombardment how the do i play
way i can't i mean i can play at nine or if i have like an item for him
okay like i like my board like even though i can go nine like shouldn't i just roll i'm like looking at this
i lost to someone with 50 gold tr there it's
fine i about to roll a little bit like oh wait k to stick to the plan we have a plan okay
i mean this board is is actually stable i mean i can i can actually end the game
with way i don't think i'm ever going to end the game with liliia i just hit rock
on like am i am i really going to end with dl lords no am i ending the game with lilia
probably not cuz i' rather just play a
zer and like i i have way already i'm going put on way okay it's
fine wait what oh did i did i bum probably what do you want to do later
i'm last pick
really i don't see this board winning tbh well yeah
i bro my entire board is garbage the only unit i'm keeping on my final board is
seta and maybe annie maybe spirit reveal our way our okay also
nautilus paired annie paired like how how many anies are gone like i think nautilus i can probably hit
like are there a lot of annies gone like not really okay is necessary i mean you have
to hit something yeah will okay nus two i'm done rolling a total winter trickers
glass
no what happened wait what are they ping i think
it was it was a cver player right
what actually is not stronger until
nine are you having over there what do you want to do later
i don't i don't really mind playing dord if it's it's if it's raan like raan's actually good this see's broken as
king three wait
what what is this guy uh whatever
component i mean tg is really good but i also wouldn't mind what the are
these like i mean even if i don't get anti-heal like lowy it's fine like tg is like no matter what i'm going
tg like in like tg on rakan is broken black blows this eventually jax
ashe annie wait wait who has cane
three wait there's no way that guy's three canes and that guy had one cane there's no way wait
what this reminds me of
our are you having over there how is this like come on
please oh i have combat caster i was about to say like how the did i survive that all right nice like let me
let me see how many times my sent a like comat combat castered 600 was that the diff probably
good oh aist never i mean i can't lose tattoo of
bombardment it's too easy to play i mean i guess it opens i mean
there's no way i don't find new deer but i mean like for now like it doesn't actually do anything but then like i like i can't like i can't like it's it's
too good right now okay also no matter what i'm playing l i don't care like how do i play l i i i'm not selling rakan cuz
i might hit on
too i just get an annie to i probably just suck
one yeah you
all right about to level and send the next turn
paint fades life

fades this is necessary i mean i have warding on my
board though this nautilus is is getting solded
momentarily art is empty without empathy every flow bls to be
seen i mean like this board like if i two star everything can this board win
like ashe two list 2 way 2 i mean there's no way i don't play udar like and then uder over
aatrox okay also i should probably scout like it surely i don't go for something like like i i choose one or the
other i rather go for annie annie is an actual win
that is so op i don't know how it sound al i'm pretty sure there's no an

g no prison hold you we are made by our
choices last time i h was never
everys to be seen watch
this okay i think i'm just going to commit
sh shh oh it's looking
good i mean i probably just won't even paint actually no bro come on i only have five man
with me why does it look like i didn't kill a single unit
here hello i got killed by this stupid ass lux this
game oh is that from me
get him no no no like come on man

like wait it's a full naturous
jg wait i just go lilia 3 as well i i could also just save the paint
but like i'm probably going to survive four rounds so i don't even mind just painting the let me see if i find one more hold
me every flower blooms to be
seen this is the board
okay like should i even paint
here and then like it sets the the like on a timer i i just have to start four rounds which i probably
will yeah i probably will
it like 56 56 for four rounds that's pretty easy i
think oh blue bu on this is true abis redemption's acceptable i can go tg tg glove belt bf
i blue on lilia is too good o dear y i channel the spirits i feel closest

to i i could also just go redemption like should i even go
i mean it's fine it's fine it's not that good because it probably dips but i mean hp is hp like
whatever this how many enies are gone oh i need a paint oh i
did i'm pretty sure my lilia's about to do 3,000 damage here my board's actually
insane saar bis lilia bis senna bis way
bis annie
with me pain f hey it did do top dps i that's
pretty good hey jack too this one's got
fire i'm guaranteed to survive three rounds reveal our way i i probably won't even go for the leo 3 i' rather just
make gone how many anies are gone
zero wait i'm not stupid yeah zero and he's gone oh okay bet it's
just another first all right bet at our i'm i'm sitting here okay i

thing uh i mean let me just level and just sit on
this i mean if i lose it i'll just sell a jax i'm free in shadow plus
one and then i'll i'll evaluate based on uh how the stage
goes like if i get like
honestly if i find like one more shen like am might not just rrolling here i have five shen two senna level six 40
gold and then that basically just carries me straight through the year for

those cuz it's also set also free umbral and i mean set two is set two it's
pretty decent it's also i have tattoo of uh tattoo of force tattoo of vitality so i can also put on new dear

zia yeah i there's not even enough l is in
the
pool he has three lists
yeah great

what but like i wouldn't be losing every round if i had one vol bear and one in one zia but i like like what
i chel the spirits i feel closest to
okay i mean i just need one
hello i'm pretty sure i can't even hit set wait my f
onbody he just sold i bet
i'm pretty sure reia beats a set
though good job everyone i'm coming for you
i mean no matter what i need to play i want to play fated for him but but like really actually shits on set like
doesn't it just perma sun
probably uh tracers
i held the greatest
blessing i will not hold
back
okay i think i'm dead i'm pretty
sure my guy just gets permon and it's dead this guy
sucks nice yay okay but like i don't even care
about the set three how the do i not see a single zia six out
of the pool like not one zia like
hello and then not one vol bear like what ah like
please like if i find one z am i not going second this game guaranteed i would have saved i would have won both
of the rounds i'd be 37 hp with set three ah this game is terrible like


and watch this list on carousel end the game list my side
l you know what you're actually motivating me tomorrow like okay let let me make sure i don't do mod today and
then tomorrow i promise i promise tomorrow i'm not going to like i'm not going to grief a single game like you're
like you actually will not see like a single grief
okay okay oh man i got all gold no units in with your
side oh
sh anima vis trickers glass
okay i don't like this animal visage item but like if i have cho to like how
bad can this item
be get in touch with your
side oh what the wait i i wait i might just go like ch three for for free
wait what i just i just roll ch three this game and then i'll just flex whatever i hit hit like if i don't hit cog like
whatever wait what the
450 health oh is it wait is exalted wait chath caitlyn are
exalted stay down
what the
oh thank god oh another ch guys
uh like i i kind of want a chain item on this like do like do i really want to
go it's it's not warm by the way it's not good like this unit's hp is insane the like the stats you know the
stats on chogath i'm pretty sure it says sunfire is true b like i'm almost certain it does like should i just make
it or should i check real quick i should probably check real quick
huh but it's because it it it's not like her up time oh wait
jenna as you
wish it is not true bis it is not true bis it is the opposite of true bis
okay i mean spark is true b though and then it says dclaw but i have anima vis
or spirit vis i mean it says bramble is tris i mean spar i mean spark has to be
tris this unit actually does magic damage be eaten
fast it has to be r right i mean it has burn but like it it's it's kind of good
also i don't have a single coga is that going to be a
problem
coming the thing is that the exalted is
creatures this c like i kind of want to just oh what the
oh okay i mean okay i mean i'll probably just send it to like 10 in two turns
then what oh okay i mean yay like i mean what
did i do to deserve this nothing the game sucks the game
sucks i mean another ch to
uh i mean redemption's good on another unit but the thing is i can't kill the tear i the b sword is hot
garbage and then let's like how else do i kill the bf i can't and this is half uh nashers and
then this is what is this oh it's bro vest oh i'm three
streaking bro this has to be the best kog mod cho opener i've seen bf with gun blade no one's building
a gun blade on kog mod relax buddy you're killing your rod to make a gun
blade yeah okay your cogma is about to sit there and do
nothing oh man it's gone
oh a three cost rod like what you're seven gumble playing around tear no you're making chosen playing
around
rod i me okay i'm down to roll until 20 here i mean it's one goal to roll for two more turns
bro what the is this i'm hitting everything
what holy
i'm back i'm a beast where the is caitlyn it's not
even good it actually isn't where's kate hello okay thank you
and then the and then the exalted is is this yeah like cog i'm just pushing unless unless my next shop
naturals me a cog cuz like natur be like two hogs or something cuz it's one go to roll it's actually so
cheap come on chath
that is good such
creatures um i mean okay let me roll until at least kate i mean it's one goal to roll like the shops are way too
cheap i'm what's your name okay i i'm going for call 3 for
sure i don't know what kate looks like iald the greatest
blessing what does kate look like oh

okay one go to roll i'm just cho three cog three full streak i need a kate it's
that it's actually not good damn i'm a
beast this is brought to you by um whatever the ad i just did yep
at
bezos oh i can make 20 oh yeah i can balloon
gallo okay well that's not
good i watch this like like the bow
b rod or glove and
chain i am playing k i always roll for three star at five oh no no you can roll a little bit but like no this game is
different it it hit yor oh aloom oh man i need a kate though
oh full nashers they call me there
righty um okay so where is the
k whatever like al i mean i can't even play until level six anyway so it's fine
whatever stupid
game like kate plus uh alune is free exalted i probably will end the game
with exalted this game leon plus uh
arelia i wouldn't be i i would actually i i wouldn't be surprised if i actually just 100 this game i'm so far ahead of
tempo that i'll be like level eight the same time as the tempo players are going level eight except i just i just loaded with
ch3 cog three level 5 40 gold
no it's impossible not to find the c like i have all the ch all the all the c you can't even hit them and then i'm guaranteed
did uh mythic plus one ldp
i plus one is a 4.04 lp is
3.9 not behemoth crust all right so where where is the
kate the kate
please 16 level i'm not going to bother leveling your f i'm st one it of
the past oh it's not good like the mythic sucks like why would i cap around mythic when i can i can ldp
like these giga units and then cap around like irelia like this game uh the exalted is choke eight so i'm just
capping around leis in irelia for
sure i have to like play these garbo units nah
i probably will play five mythic cuz i think uh i think nautilus is good i think way is good i think lilia is okay
but like not really like invoker is like fake as because koga's too auto sucess regardless and then like no
matter what i'm capping around irelia but also where is the
uh hello i need a kate
come let me show you
darkness i just need a kid eventually it gives me
um yeah what's the
board i don't even know why i'm thinking so hard it's probably pretty easy i'm like sitting here pretending to to to
make a board when the game played itself you are such kous creatures

wait you know what i'm probably actually going to get this cuz who the wants ice cream
cone like no one's going ice cream cone oh and the glove is like the
rod is so flexible i just got a bramble the rod i can make i can make rabadons i can make
arc i can make like who the cares i can make anything all right so where's the gate your journey or die in
mine spirits are calling

like there's no way i end the game without a single kate i don't believe
it i have 18 copies without a single kate what the
such okay i mean with uh with this i
think i might actually cap around like with the ice cream cone it
might actually be correct to just go like aoon instead of oh a cate never a dull
moment
all right this it might actually be correct to cap
around uh i don't think it matters cuz i'm probably still going to play i just don't play nautilus the na no but
then nautilus is actually kind of good like it's probably always way i
mean it's probably lilia as well cuz i have an ice cream cone where's lilia
way way le this is the board and then i
probably go fast 10
for oh go five exalted oh is that good uh gallo gallo le in whatever no
one gallo lein all right i play alon instead of
lilia
but then i have to play nautilus and gallo how how is that even possible travel
aits oh no who's good though cuz i'm i'm going to have leftover items and then i have ice cream
cone like i'm probably going to go like i'm probably going to get start building items for way now
oh gun blade nice for their
souls give your journey or die in okay and then now start building towards onms
actually why don't i just say yeah like why don't i just go like the
malite the nico and then i just go nautilus with
uh wait what sorry wait wait oh i oh wait oh
oh no i
uh i mean do i care about warden where's warden's like i can go set
to rakan
to i this
oh no behemoth oh oh oh oh oh okay wait oh it's oh it's udyr for sure yo
these guys it's udyr plus one these are all i mean je lotus
is like good on other i mean how much crit is this 60 i'm going to have so
many carries with the ice cream as well i mean it's not this it's not that garbage station support i can
lower but this literally can't low roll take it if you
can
um i i can play set or i can play rakan
i guess it just depends if i with notu or not bro this is the easiest game i have ever
played what the is
this it's five oh not really but i mean the units are good though five is like whatever but the units are good
i'm going straight to nine so i mean i'm probably going straight to 10
now keo let's move i've got people toire
hawi okay also let me let me uh do a quick
scout and make sure these
losers oh i mean it's not got 25% extra right cuz it it scales based off your
base so like for example like it goes to like whatever it is yeah but it's also relative to three but not only that like
the items itself give so much ap it's not that much of an increase like it's it's not that good but i mean nautilus 2
is nus 2 way 2 is way 2 so i mean it's fine like you get some free stats but it's not actually that
good uh oh i need to start scouting and making sure people don't hit some stuff oh 25% for exalted oh oh it's not
that good it it's actually not cuz the thing is it's like yeah these units get do 25 but like the thing is bro i'm
playing like quadruple reverse spawn when i could just be playing like the juicers like the the good units you know
what i
mean like not the not like no one's playing a gallo on there gallo zero synergy some other trash zero
synergy nah i'd rather i'd rather just play like irelia 2 udyr to rakan to like gallo just sits
there pretends to fight
man i was going to i was going to go rod but honestly shouldn't i try to build towards the the uh a morello i mean or tg i
was going to go rod but then i kind of want tg oh wait what the okay heart is empty without i don't really want to
commit the remover here
but honestly i can just say the like uh i still have exalted in bro it i
don't even know what it's called
uh invoker this is
garbage poemon no matter what it's twoos to cast fades life fades
okay i'm going to do a quick scout all i'm just going to look at everyone's board can you let me know what people are going
for honestly i can just do it myself y y i don't really care about these like three star four cloak like volar plus
whatever bro this lobby is so weak what the even happened
thros is any anyone going for three star four cost no what even happened everyone's so
weak boring no prison can hold me
level 930 on stage
4 the power of a
dragon where even

playing i mean it's better for now but i
okay honestly i'm just going for a three star five cost you can't
miss okay i kind of want to play list for a little bit
longer all right i kind of want to play list for a little bit because i kind of want another component
is so cool final
never rest what is this it's warden as
well who cares man like this this one component if i
can farm it is worth 7 million
gold what even is the board you dear irelia plus
one oh no no the streak like the streak i'm i'm going for three star legendary it's fine what's more exciting
100 hp or or three star legendary
y with me oh man oh it's fine it'll it'll get a
eventually oh man i think i
lost like this this will farm a component eventually don't
worry wouldn't wish my f on anybody leaving i'm
leaving what i mean it might be a low d it's
fine who cares
just when you see my board on like when when you see my board on
61 and i can time it so like i can i can hatch on like 62 or
whatever oh man i still didn't farm one it's fine it's fake it's fake like you know these are actually illaoi diffs but
it's like who the is like there's no way in 78 hp the list doesn't f me a single component come
on one
i might just reforge this like you can't
miss so why don't i just take the higher and oh i mean that's fine
oh i really don't like gum blade on this unit though it's it's to do to it's
fine i'm playing set i mean i'm not playing this
all right one component
please see his i oh is he
dead away where's my
component a man boring

i refuse to play set this unit is so like i'd rather just i' rather even play three beman
bro can i farm one component man just
one honestly i'm probably actually ending the game with with l anyway no like like isn't it just raan cuz
like in this matchup it's too good
like i can just
lose how am i three invoker oh oh oh
sorry no one cares about ar doesn't do anything our asion is at
wouldn't wish my fed on
anybody i
never the power of a dragon like protector's
vow on this dude honestly adapted
i mean these match ups it's so good for list i'm going to hit l two for sure
i'm 40 gold i'm going to send it in two turns and then try to hatch the last legendary and call it last time i
never oh like bro no one's going for a three star like a three star four cost that's so
boring surrender my tri is inevitable ashe kate bro it's it's it's
exalted it's exalted it's
exalted i i feel clos okay yeah no one's going for
lilia this just so boring why does it look i'm losing every
fight
h can i even go irelia 3 no this
guy never
rest strength of spirit i have
qss might as well just
wait like i don't even want to paint cuz
i won't be able to paint another one like i can only paint one five cost not all those three bad i'm
not going that like if i lose i lose who the cares
oh i don't want to paint cuz i can only paint one and you want to paint later like why like why would i paint now when i can just paint later you want to find
like the the
first i mean i don't i just don't want him to get it but this heavenly is useless for me
my journey is only
beginning i can play wukong too over
something n whatever
it sck to the plan we have three a man
well i think i'm going to
win oh wait no i think i lost well i think i'm going to lose i
think i'm going eighth
hello all right hopefully i win this round strength of spirit otherwise i
have to just paint cuz i'm not trying to die guys the kate the kate is is exalted
the kate is exalted like please
ah okay i mean okay this this n assault is illegal
like surely not
right
what oh man

i'm just going to ldp ice
cream of the dragon's
fury we are made by our choices i'm not selling until i find one
more oh i chel the spirits i feel
closer oh bet of


what please like if i make it to ro i just win the game like come
on oh gs for free and yo what
the well like the comps that that spiked earlier are slightly
better because even if you low roll later your holy it's or
orelia in the exalted all right well i'm going fast night i don't care if i die i
die
gg's is salman a bad augment it's good like early like earlier if you have like a suboptimal slam but like once your
like it it gets worse and worse as the game goes on cuz you get less
value cuz at a certain point you're just committed to your

comp the k they call me jolly they right
rod tear all right lucky pause fa treasure silver veil good for something
blistering strikes what the riven to okay i'm fast
nine violence to end violence i go where the trouble is

it i'm pass
f i win this anyway right where try it's actually bugged bro it's
my my placements are not even that bad it is bugged let me see is it fixed
no no it's actually bug
though it's like a full gold opener bar treasure is pretty strong early game cuz uh everyone only has two
components i'm basically double rs components for these three rounds and if i can win the first 10 rounds that's actually fast
nine team o b tear bf rod shun plus rod player on
bow i show play on b rod we're go sh put around bf rod
shun b
rod is this spot a little too good
level five making 10 on two two riven
two oh yeah i can do this i go where the trouble is and if i
win this next round honestly it's not even that good cuz my front line is i have no front line items and i'm playing
t carry rod bow
shan over encumbered tear cloak is's not
slamming oh that's pretty good for me level five that's not good he's kind of strong i'm fighting
him hello hello bro this guy's so strong please he
slammed adaptive man it didn't even cast a single time
and bye-bye damn nice adaptive and level five he's making 20 oh man it's okay

your journey uh i i don't really want to s ginu
i mean i could i could remake the teemo and then put the crown guard on frontline
unit but honestly is that even worth it like these items are actually good that gu lucks too my board sucks
i'm just going to lose like whatever my board straight up
sucks i mean it's not that bad uh like but if i win this round i kind of want
to if i win this round it's worth trying to go for five
streak oh what the okay maybe i don't even need to to
do anything and i'm five streak i mean teo two silver 2
like if i could greed here and not like i don't really want to make like i don't really want to make guinsoo it doesn't really do anything

all right well it's a five streak and i don't even have to
slam so i i have perfect items post crugs okay well
boring and

guarante and oh i mean zara that's pretty good i guess
come
closer
and leave your journey or die in
mine something good oh bread buff that's really good
oh i am a okay well i won the game gg's i don't get
it i mean teemo is like the the the easiest fast nine of all time le in
garen i will
notter it's for the easiest fast nine
man this is a lux player so i want to cover right oh nice and after this i can
greed my cver
positioning get back from
coming nah
n a from this probably won point like one point whatever oh
late game specialist i'm going straight to honestly doesn't lunch money actually give me
more gold like 33 cuz that one only gives me gold when
i'm level 9 but like let's say i get like like
five gold like like then then 10 gold next stage
15 okay much money it is 32 to level i can go 10 and then go
straight to i mean i can level
for yi 2 uh not this turn the y two guys
actually kind of scary
i don't get it oh he actually killed infinite oh
bet two gold already making 50 it's already three gold and then i can level
and probably still make some econ so it's even more gold so i basically just won the game for
free warden 32
i mean it's looking good really good
y oh what the oh this guy's kind of
strong uh the problem with uh greeding the uh the thing here is cu it gets trapped i'd rather hug right cuz of the
only player
if i get lunch money here bro this teo unit when you have items for him and you have a front line for him he's so broken
like where did his team go oh bet making 30 so i'm up two four i'm up six gold
now oh the game's over this is the best open i've ever
had 9 uh 51 full
legendary uh shoan rabbit on red gramble belt tear bf belt
item a it's probably like 2 point it's probably like 2.5 it's really it's like mid mid low twos probably i was open is
really good
i'm zoe what's your
name it's going to get trapped there but i have to hug this i'm not trying to get
yon is this the yoni 2 with 50 gold bro he's y only 240 gold how hello
atm atm it hit teo anyway and
bye-bye oh nice and now i'm going back to greeding
it kha'zix encounter 36 kha'zix i'm
40 gold yeah and
kha'zix a man
boring an irelia wait it's not even
good i know i mean know it is good but i i mean i can't tell this teo this te
wait it's or irelia i mean i'm definitely upgrading s too i mean i can
play i can play five story i do even do anything a man saka 2 saka 2 rone maybe
find a replacement to teo2 a
man know re is broken but it's only broken with red off and it's not i'm selling teo too i'm not
stupid that's
fine it's not it's actually not that good like i can't even play this re until level 9 or i mean i
can oh holy this just gave me like infinite lunch money the
wait oh wait maybe he just dies from 14 someone just kills him
off well if i hit uh oh actually no i'm probably going to level for
ni but if i hit another te too i probably can go shun rabon red buff here i'll just wait no matter what i'm c
around or or irelia plus one maybe i just end the game with garen or or irelia i
mean lu or filios remover i mean i could remover
itc is never gued i want to see
everything belt pf belt
belt how much hp i losing
if i want to remover it shun rabons and then no i don't have another
item bro just look at my spot just
look oh nice luck's not on correct side my team was alive
i think this guy's giving me free lunch money as well take back your
spirits wait everything must go and i'm i'm going and then i just go for three star five cost
i mean isn't that like not a real win
though wait he got everything must
go okay well i probably don't need it to win but i'll allow it my on
anybody i just hold all the five cost but i just load in with a three star five cost i'm playing five cost
roll five cost to roll
everything must go i just need to deny some of his
i'll just keep i'll just keep an eye on him let me see what anyone
else oh it's only him okay
i don't have shred though i i guess i have a eventually lock it is lock it way
heart is empty without empathy it's probably going to be weaker but i can start painting like right now
that mean it's weaker for sure and then also how do i get exalted
in like luck
heaven bless me
final that's okay
bf sword i'm going to be spreading the items it's kind of a grief spreading the
items that's okay db
ie i don't even know which one's better i they're both good
though i chanel the spirits i feel closest
i is better match wait what is what is
match i mean okay no matter what i'm playing around or over this like or uder
what is he even going for dude this guy
looks like he's
lost al i can follow my now i did not kill a single unit healing 10 three
that's
bless uh okay also let me f out my board okay so it's or orelia let me just get rid like let me just figure out my board
right now garen it's probably saka saka garen garen free exalted garen saka

riven i am so lost where's riven okay riven saraka is already upgraded irelia
for sure h for sure or for sure or udyr 1 two 3 4 5 6

hello uh yes
please transcendence is never
guaranteed i want to see everything the power of a dragon

these okay i just toal 50 until i'm low three star legendary call it a day
s also i don't have to play exalted like yeah i mean it's a really or with
me so it's actually not bad right three in a loss the
cares there's our i mean i could play
heaveness oh man the power of a
dragon we are made by our
choices one roll
i mean uh like okay let me roll to i
mean list two is list two
i these like no no one's going for three star these this bad
i mean i should probably just paint something i should i should probably
roll
until ios i found irelia and way so should i just
paint all right i go list three
then of spirit we can be her
i'm a z two on bench
hey okay i mean let let me do a quick scout

rabadons sak's exalted oh no no not not exalted wait
what is saka doing oh it's supposed to be saka oh it's altruist it's supp saka with rakan it it's supposed to be sraa with
uh but then but but then like
yeah wait what i have another
turn what is he going for i should probably put this back in
the pool like silus
3 list my pr pr gold fck altruist i'm
down i'm down i'll just wait i'm going to i'm just going to
probably just play this set instead of rock
on with me
a then i might as well lose riven i mean garen is is the thing i mean i might as well lose riven then like no one cares
about story weaver
yeah you don't wor right you can buffer you can buffer don't
worry final
sight finalight
he's going for
silus i mean honestly i kind of want to go 10 instead of rolling on ad ods roll
on ad ods for what also i could play
or exalted free warden
zero gold at 10 i mean i mean that's fine i mean the odds the odds on nine are so
bad if i 10 i uh i have like 20 gold 10 shops the odds on like nah like the odds
here are so bad paint fades life fades
the power of a dragon hello don't let me go silus 3

please i i might as well suck one more right for perfect interval or wait
18
probably finalight how come my my irelia or not my irelia
my i almost lost honestly my board looks so bad i don't have a single synergy on
my board can someone do math for me greatest
like next turn is is it 60 to level next turn oh yeah it is okay nice bro like
the amount of like okay listen 50 50 gold of rolls on 10 is better than it
goes from 10% to 25% like please please please oh wait oh yeah i should paint next
turn hello okay perfect thank
you no no it's not it's not i'm not i'm not going to kill him here it's fine and then i'll i'll i'll open don't worry
just clear mind clear bench clear bench clear
mind
undeniable fin did i kill him off oh wait i think this guy's
dead okay it's fine it's fine no it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine
stick to the plan we have a plan wouldn't wish my f on
anybody heart is empty without empathy i'm just going to start bug abusing all
right it's all good you know what maybe if i start bug abusing they'll get rid of this stupid ass augment
show we are made by our choices fate is our
hands we are made by our
choices i mean i'm one off of list but do i even want to paint the
list stick to the plan
oh
man i don't even know what i want what the do i even want
here way oh am i close to way oh here's the bug ready hello you ready for me
like look okay you put this on you sell it oh 20 gold huh i mean it's not that relevant at
certain intervals oh wait let's three what the but like it's so cringe
like i don't even know how this augment it's bugged it's blatantly bugged people in higho don't do it but like i guarantee you people are doing it
lowo oh i could have went for more oh
like ah it's just so cringe man
bro i did cuz the game's already over i i i' i've yet to bug abuse fury with it but you get free gold
by just you just buy the z you put it on the board and you sell it it is been bugged for like 3 days


i mean a morello 3 is a morello 3 i'm just
saying i went six pad
i don't really want to play loot sub again i don't really want to play trainer sentinels all right whatever loot sub it is whatever i think loot sub
is like the most okay you okay loot sub has like the the lowest lows loot sub has the lowest lows but
has like the highest
highs oh bet it's like it's lame when someone just like h rolls
like a prismatic trait and then you can just like they just win for free but if everyone has like if it's
not like just non-stop spats and tos it's kind of fun like it's just more items war but it gets boring when like
they just keep giving
tos oh rex side three for
free this unit is kind of a
beast dpi i have no
idea oh she oh sorry
they call me jolly they're
right i go where the trouble
is bard jax caitlyn yasuo
oh is this a uh loot sub yeah i am i probably should
have fought
that hello can someone choose something
please wandering trainer to yeah okay great
yay it's a to i mean 10
mythic just popping
now it
i'm done to play towards kaiso this
game fortunate i'm winning but i'm already winning though like i would need another tone
for it to be good oh i oh
light up i mean at least i got fortune
y this story is not yet finished
oh
oop okay i mean maybe i can just h roll another to and get seven fortune in you
think you today
okay who's the worst unit here cuz the thing is he's open
is it kate probably never a dull

moment nice and i gep this guy it's lit and i think he gives me a unit kill
that is
good let me show you darkness
a three cost bf sword that's also good what's the
tattoo bombardment yep
fortune
sucks all right let's go to emerald plus first 26% win
rate 26% win rate and now let's go to gm plus oh wa what the is this you just instantly win the game i guess it's
all good you just admitted that you suck yourself

but honestly i mean okay i mean the thing is fortune is less good in loot sub because everyone gets more loot right but fortunate is like
broken when it like like like the amount of loot that people can get is like
fixed but like but in loot sub like the difference isn't as big but it's still
good you forgot to say no disrespect oh yeah no disrespect like i'm probably
still going to win this game like it doesn't even matter if it's loots up or not
four one two 35 is perfect is that 30 on 35
actually you 30 on 35 i think it is and then that's a 40% chance for a to so i'm
actually done to catch out there
and then if i hit fortune plus two i'm just seven fortune for
fore wa it be like five like seven yeah yeah it's 30 wait 30 is is 30 is 40%
chance for home right
oh it is 40% and that's pretty good i'll take those odds

so must it be to again oh it's just gold bad
i mean like that's like this is what i mean like it's not that good because the thing is usually the fortune cash out gives you gold but everyone just gets
infinite gold so it's like like if i can cash out 50 gold it's different if i c like let's say i cash out a million gold
right but it gives everyone in the lobby 5 million gold like is i 1 million gold even that good no i mean like who cares

a this might be too
strong well not this fight but like in other fight might be too strong
lux two jenna 2 k to
light him
up

find okay i'm pretty i mean i'm pretty sure i get dump regardless okay and that is
fine oh that it's not even a bad loss i killed like two units two units i that's fine all right
next one is is uh 40 charge 40% chance for a to let me start setting it up 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 maybe get i will not hold back what is this
duels plus fated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 all right 10
okay this is necessary it's
time 40% chance for to and then i don't know like not that high chance but like i mean i have a 20% chance to just
instantly win the game seven fortune hello
7 fortun oh no but i would just roll for is it not worth oh no i'm catching on a
30 i mean i'm i'm taking this for sure like like
what all right it's fine here it comes i'm
back okay i mean free annie for me there's somehow no annie but okay that's
fine i guess y
i mean it doesn't matter who cares cuz i can just roll for it like
level to seven roll for seven fortune i could also just roll on not really
oh man i didn't get it t i roll the
one it doesn't matter i still won the game let me show you
darkness i have a cinder on my board okay who cares rod rod belt cloak

can't it actually can't
be out of the darkness
en honestly i'm pretty sure this darius can just drain tank the entire
board no triforce like i can actually just front line it just kills
everyone yeah put in
corner like one person with anti but it's not even real triforce hodge
vt
huh t i mean there's nothing to do man this game's already over not my should
have i'm just uh i should probably scout
let see what people
playing forget the past it only clouds the
future no matter what i'm playing duos for this
guy let me see level up spark ghostly
plus one gargoyle wandering trainer with alist mythic ink shadow shopping spirit with
guinsoo guinsoo shopping spry fos and pumping up which is
darkness we find ourselves holy i got my first
win when to slam haj when to slam bt on
well uh bt is better on the the tanks but oh holy i mean i mean this i'm getting this
but uh i mean it's just also early game like you just slam it cuz also like i i could just go doo carry uh kayn this
game
uh down for
belt have even troud have antiheal prably even troud i have a y to forget the past it
only clouds the future i mean i'd rather go triforce triforce on y then hodge the other dude try force try force bett i
have a y to if i want it but honestly this uh this darius is so op early
game my destination is clear and i would have to sell the
darias i mean i could remake sell this move uh but i kind of want the triforce
on it right
bro darius is so broken like you can't tell me darius is
not the best one
cost he he's a straight of beast he's like the best y holder best uh vol holder
and he just runs around just shits on everyone upgrade your next two or g i

i can hatch no i oh no it's 50/50 on riven and unless i find the
diana it's 50/50 on that dragon lord invoker i can hatch a jana guaranteed if
i find koga oh oh i have a cog wall wait

back kobuko too koga a
hatana kobuko too front
line they call me char they're right do i even want to hatch shana
though slamon scoreboard scrapper bow
ti i mean i don't have a choice
right what i get duelist
sa it's p
bfo too
healy go there's no you're playing cog with uh with
slaming i'm probably just playing janna zoll i'm g to have two is there anything i can guaranteed to
hatch i don't think so i mean like rock on later i
guess is s still bugging works on pv yeah i think so oh what the i mean
i'm not a bug of user or anything though i'm just saying by your command
coming i i mean i don't even know like i
lose cog 2 but then i move items to this one but then i also lose invoker i mean it's fine it's not like i can make econ
anyway i don't really have anything to play i have something to play on five though cuz i much rather play story
oh yeah it's probably not stronger this kind of
good if i win this round i me i did i'm going level for
sure start streak yeah voker is fake but but not uh
not cog like cog too but i'm getting rid of this ass cog in a sec oh what the this oh this is so good for me
what wait what the
who since i'm not playing towards like zyra like i mean this is actually fine i get a guinsoo and a anti-al item
the and then there's also two jan in my shop all right let me okay it's also a nico 2 let me get rid of this
trash get rid of this trash nico 2 zyra
level garen blue

as you wish okay holy i won this game i'm five j the game just
started what the wait wait wait what the
hello i think i lost anyway i
did okay keepers duelist four duelist last gun blade four duelist like come on
like i mean my board's good like i even have anti for this guy okay it's okay not a
problem okay but usually when i play this comp i'm like really rich and i am not that rich
i wait i kind of want that is that for
me a man i mean des zy with the cloak it's half gargo half spark it's
fine no my stats on on janna zyra duo bro like come on can you guys let them know i literally average it in the once
i played it three games it's one 121 and the two was supposed to be a
one like it actually was
i'm so poor i don't get
it but uh but both the games i like i five streaked and then this game is not looking like a five streak i mean i yeah
i mean i already lost two rounds in but i do have slam in to to help me
keep up with intervals and then also like no matter what i can
hatch i mean i can hatch a zoe but i can i can also
hatch i'm kind of down to hatch zoe it's not even bad it's free arcanist free it's basically a
fawn 1 two 3 four i don't really want to sell zyra
oh there's a diana this is necessary and i just hatch thise and then i
play unless i i don't want to lose
econ like it looks like i'm poor but it's fine i got i have slam it it's okay
okay nice at least at least i win this round i'm not just dying for free and then i can also bug
abuse which is just
bissan thought it was just a harless bre wait what caught wait
what you can miss once cuz bad yeah i mean but it's fine it's not a big deal i'm done to just not
miss oh it's not b i mean it's just sl wor on neutrals you just you just scam i
mean honestly you miss like missing once is fine cuz the interval you know what i
mean but i'd rather not miss here cuz it's easier to kill kugs than later it's easier to figure out off kugs cuz
there's not enough item drops but like you can miss once cuz like no matter what perfect inter roll
no place while i'm free it's another
ni can our spirits be
friends okay i'll just remake these i refuse to
miss oh but also i don't even want like i don't want any of these these are all what's your name
i mean i might as well just play the this on this for
now like i mean i i don't like what i'm making a gs a gs jenna i think i'd rather go
eigth like i want natur's tooth i mean bt
nico oh i'm a zyon bench oh sorry that's fine whatever bt n it is
sorry this bf word is
useless honestly do i even go for diana 3 this game probably not cuz i have uh five nikos i'm just going to go nik
zarra jenna all right it drop blossom i mean i've already invested a sunfire on
this piece of garbage but honestly i'm kind of down to take drop
blossom radiant
refractor i mean it's not this i mean this is oh dr lotus
three two for one honestly two for one from this spot is actually kind of good true 3 is also good though and n i'm
just guaranteed to hit everything thing violence and then i just go for natur's
tooth i don't even want to slon oh let me do this i don't even want to slam it
on like i like the thing is it it's encounter so it's like how do i know there's not just like a full item on
there like it feels so bad but i guess i can just bounce it and i don't really
want to remake any of these units maybe i remake zoe eventually
it's fine it's fine i i can just bounce out i'll probably guarantee j 3 soon soon that's
fine i bought a unit
right i'm not going to play around the encounter that gives like a full
item uh saraka is my next in that's fake news teo
silus all one off okay i need to win this
round or i can't make econ
that's some want to sell him just move it to di already i can't even see what the going on is that strong oh
low
too and i just don't play niik 3 i mean nik 3 is actually kind of good that's okay you know i'm pretty
sure this is two rounds in a row where i would actually win this if i dre lotus but like two for one like i'm sacking like like what 40 hp but i'm
like three star i'm way ahead of tempo
ours as soon as it hits 41 pry start
everything has an artifact okay belt plus item a dfg tear gamblers belt plus dfg dfg zyra
okay that's fine the eternal winter is gone okay nice i mean no one's building
a dg on jana oh this is actually so good for me all right bet full n tooth full uh
full item for zyra i'm guaranteed nik 3 zyra 3 the dude
three it's looking good really
good i mean i can just upgrade diana to this round
all right how many more rounds do i need like one round here would be six like three rounds one
two wait did i already buy one one two three and i need four
copies five copies and two copies but like while i roll i probably will hit some other stuff and then i level for
saka of the okay
my dude just got one shot across the map it's
okay definitely incorrect what is wait what
i mean like bro no like listen you don't build like just read this man like come on like half of her kit no
one's building a gs i can actually move items to diana this game as
well i'm definitely going z three while
free hold bless i mean i can move items onto here
since it's two star okay
swi wo like do not worry it looks like i'm getting i'm getting dumpstered but just
wait like i'm down a prismatic i'm just saying i would have won every single round this stage i'm pretty sure it's not two for one cuz i would have won three okay i probably would have
lost this fight but i wouldn't have won all three of these if i had du lotus probably i'd be 90
hp i two star everything like yeah your all right it one roll and
one more roll it okay i probably should stop rolling i one off
one off one off one off or like one off one off and then two
off and then what am i hatching here whatever it doesn't matter there's no four cloak
anyway i i need to i need to be careful about the five c though cuz i want to hatch i don't know
something we j you a full
spark let's move i've
okay and then next
turn next turn i go for uh i'm going to roll into ayra
i still want z three items for her and then i'm just going to push level
eight watch this
i don't want i mean i don't want this
i mean i don't want like i don't want any of
these zoe too is zoe too cuz i also honestly i
should probably roll eight odds anyway
or 7 odds i mean cuz i still want i want diana 3 and i move item to
diana of the past this a still feels kind of good what does this average
on it's a 4.74 really
how i mean i feel like it feels kind of good no
not break me you will start to get out class next stage that's what everyone says when i play this comp but honestly
yeah i'm down combat this time so probably every time i play this oh yeah like it's like you're going to fall
off soon and i just never end up losing uh i mean i can also go like zoe
3 i me i should go for three star everything like zoe 3 diana 3 zyra 3 and
then my level eight i guarantee hatch wukong how how can i make it so i
only hatch wukong or rakan or wukong or rakan oh
wait no it's i don't think it matters which one right i i hold the heavenlies maybe
yeah i want both but it's easier to hatch it's easier to hatch wukong than it is to
hatch uh roon cuz roon like it's it's really hard to get eight units i mean i
i can go three dord i don't know which one's better on eight it's heavenly plus another sage versus it's three
alist plus another dlord i me get 10 armor r i mean ra's a better unit than
wukong is the thing so i don't really know b
belt so i don't know
the power of a
dragon uh rather go diana and then one off a
zyra no i mean i have dord here so i can
actually hit it sage here as well i me gs slam shun
i mean i slam it like and then like it's
fine gs is fine i got a ti can't miss all right zoe
3 is three rounds enough to hit three star
everything i don't know maybe also if i was on if if if that lu were on left side i'd be dead as
not break
me your or die wait i i thought i was one i'm an idiot i'm sorry i'm sorry
closer i'm an idiot i'm sorry one off that was a ro
to sorry sorry i thought i was one off i'm sorry i'm
sorry i'm sorry i zy three this round i'm sorry i'm sorry no no no i i i'm
sorry i'm sorry i i like i thought i was scamming the gold but it was a reverse scam anyways i'm one off of all three it's
fine i think i think i'll still have all all three three
starred wait am i yeah yeah i will i will okay i'm pretty sure two for one in
this comp is broken by the way like what you can just three star everything my entire boards i'm about to load in with seven three
stars a man no place is safe i'm going to have to buy it
fre oh hold on i can buy this i pick this
up oh off off a taste of the dragon's fury
this sm hello
hello there's a wukong my journey
beginning deny me no longer okay
nice that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first
days i mean like qss diana
i don't really want to roll for just zoe like i kind of want to just start going nine i have no items for zoe until way
later a so i'm just going to i'm just going to
use n on here then no matter one one off now just level to n for wukong uh i can
move items to like qss on
this i mean i rather have gs plus this on this b
like spark sunfire i' rather have
armor i go item here and i'll find zoe
eventually i is my board illegal this cuz actually auto attacks

oh actually wait how much does a sage give it's 10 starting mana 50
ice cream's kind of good though the only problem is i can't give
this the thing but who the cares 250
starting oh wait actually wait why don't stream this for now what the am i saying what who the cares oh
there's a zoe oh i'm sorry i'm sorry there's a zoe oh i'm sorry i'm
sorry it's fine zero items it's
okay bro my board is illegal i'm just three star
everything just yeah i'm going to i'll get items don't
worry either i'm just going straight to n wuhong
okay well if i knew i was going to get sage emblem then i then it was uh what's it called i messed
up like then i should have went then i should have went it zekes
for sure cuz like like like i was going to play three sage but like now it might actually be five sage instead of
uh rakan but what does rakan give it's two outra oh it is it is i mean it is at
at at 10 or whatever the it is what is this what the what's going
on uh i can move items gs cuz like dord three dord doesn't even do anything and then five sage is
basically six sage cuz it it goes from uh 45 ap to 75 ap

i'm coming for you but like i can't i can't play on this this stage cuz i'm level eight but when i'm level 9 i can
go 75 ap entire backline for
free otherwi i would just play wukong maybe i can go 10
though actually what is three altrus 10 to 20
none will escape my gr i herald the
greatest
uh lost time i ate a bl was never
oh what the oh i didn't move this to the left please please
please okay okay it's
okay beautiful baby this reminds me of our
first i'm just saying and my scores on this
comp it's in the ones this is my fourth first in a row oh no no it's it's mal fight but
it's it's not better like the zyra unit is a demon zyra or not zyra
zoe you
i just lose ice cream value
57 my journe only begin can't even see what's going
on five sage four free
okay i'm looking at these

items i level for rock on i get three out
soon i i basically have six age cuz like i mean it jumps from 45 to
75 75 ap entire backline on top
of 10 starting mana shogun 40 oh it's still two autos i i want i the greatest
blessing
qs

spt just right
stuff my destiny is clear

how much ap does this start with 325 four autos to cast
what or three autos to cast which
ojan i mean it's all good it's just another first like oh
man you're about to fall off next stage by the way this c's actually broken i
think like every time i play it it feels so op

oh i mean just look his whole board's gone bye-bye or wait
hello oh sh i inan a seventh that's pretty good wait but if you hit gallo that was
a win out no cap okay i mean if i hit gallo and silus 2 and i can make it to nine at a a
decent pace to like duo carry like veron or irelia or like get one more carry on the board and i get like an even trout
on carousel cuz it's all physical damage okay kobuko
please what' i get a garen man come on did someone get someone else get
oh nice
okay nice i mean that's six gold that's pretty good wa the exalted is kobuko and
darius my wait i'm i'm guaranteed exalted if i
hit this story is not yet finished
oh this was not that though okay i don't think i can this
game when life gives you sour blees make i mean i have a bf glove like
kobuko wants like like dclaw is good spark rod
cloak uh i don't know what else it is i don't know all i know is i feel like
it's not that
good i got a belt and the tear
redemption mulched
ascension gifts i don't even know what i'm playing this game i have belt tear
glove honestly i think this mul dogman is hiky actually
good i just don't play
exalted new day new friends sa old
week no just trust i actually think this augment is broken m mulched mulched
mulched and you just play gnar gnar kindred duo no like i'm pretty sure it's
actually good like what what does that
say it's a 4.34 but you play like four ghostly with no no no trust it's actually good
it's actually like it's actually i'm not even like it's actually
good i mean i can upgrade my next two cost but i can gain 10 gold
but honestly isn't like a kindred 2 or nar2 like insane is there any other two costs
in this comp cuz i don't want to pass up on like other stuff like all the
ghostly oh it's just gold
then no no no it no it's not because you like trust me like just trust me just trust
me it's because it's because uh you
can't pass up on on the the aatrox or the or the shen so it's like yeah you get a
two star but you're it's basically you're paying it's three shops
worth like it's not worth it like bro i just make 30 guaranteed and i don't mind sacking but i'm pretty sure i just
play like like this aum is actually broken because it averages a 4.3 and i don't think people are playing the
correct board like i i think people are just playing like narena but why don't you just play gnar
kindred i don't even know what the board is myself i think it's just for ghostly right
in darkness we find ourselves when life gives you sour
vandries maybe i get dryad dryad kobuko you never
know um anyway 1 two three four oh sorry not jax like illaoi
i don't know but i'm kind of excited because i i i like like my favorite thing to do in tft
is when like like rrolling units like everyone knows kindred sucks but highkey i think mulched makes kindred
like kind of
good kindred with chain
i want uh you want like titans pt and then you want kindred item so it's just kindred nard duo and then vertical
ghostly um okay so it's illaoi for
sure oh and then it's kayn oh lord
oh lord and then you're like you want to cap her on rexi like rexi air or is the
highest cap i mean this word's actually good if you make it there but why why does it say i have five
dryad oh oh oh if i have a triad plus one i win the game oh
like if you hit triy plus one i you actually win the game i'll hit
our wills
align but like do you see this like like like not like this 10 gold is worth way more than 10 gold and then also like
what i'm supposed to just not buy a single shen single aatrox stuff like that like i i have to buy
something makes me 30 makes me 40 makes
me 50 it's already 13 gold and also like you know what i mean and then i can buy oh man i mean it's fine like
whatever it's not much gold cuz i'm already like i don't really care about the blue streak that much cuz i'm already making 50 and i'm about a 32
roll anyway so it won't be that much
actually wait did i lose anyway these causes don't look
bad oh i mean i think i i lost anyway oh okay the
nice five lost 76 that's pretty
good our wills
align oh but what's my level six board like four ghostly with with two two like
gnar plus
kindred
probably oh a noo for free
okay okay another chain that's half titans it's
fine oh it's a full titans they call me jolly uh i don't
really want ghostly odds i don't really want bruiser odds i the we go for one turn i
don't really want reaper rods either okay bow chain
i don't really want to slam like the blue buff is way better but all right i have dryad odds all
right it's looking
good it's looking really good oh s is buffed
yeah but like i kind of want anti heal i'm probably killing the belt chain right like i don't have to go double
thing oh two healthy in this comp but that sounds like kind of good but i
have okay heavy hitters wait isn't heavy hitters on drad like op cuz the thing is drad scale
infinite like that's the scaling woke
it's the scaling wch agreed too healthy like i mean okay it's really good but like
that okayy all right let me let me roll so i can actually get some stacks
going so i'm not just a for free watch
there in darkness we find ourselves shentu
gnar okay silus no prison can hold me okay i board
doesn't look that bad okay but also i need i need to figure out my items all right am i putting am i putting items on rexi i'm probably not hitting the ding
three okay allawi senna oh i okay why am i not
playing aaoi by the way i even playing sena no
honestly i should probably roll until two are both why am i not rolling here i mean s like my bo is not even that bad
like sh two i'm probably not hitting this
but let me show you it's not even wor going for this
let me show you dness all i'm a la pair and the other d
pair okay nice kind two run our
okay like don't worry our wills align i i could just go tear glove but i
kind of want blue up here i don't really care about h
3 i'm going shen through here i'm just i'm pretty sure i'm just griefing a shen player
oh wait this gu's a vol too like i'm not just griefing a shen player here yeah whatever the sh players that's not
bad wait i can't play it though it's not good oh there's a cane but has a
belt i mean one redemption is good but like i can't kill the tear the tier's gone like should i just
go with the cane it's reaper for free like i i have a belt like oh
honestly okay actually never mind like redemption like guard breaker on on a reaper unit is actually kind of good
okay okay okay i mean that's actually kind of good i have to take this and then i i don't really care about rex ey
i'm not even going to bother going for reide 3 i go kayn ghostly reaper get stacks scale with the
thingy i'm just griefing a shen player fs you today definitely need to hold on
to one of them though uh guard breaker on reaper unit is really
good i don't really i can't really slam shun though because i want bt as
well okay kindred rexi okay oh nice i found kayn oh that's
pretty
good yeah this sp's not bad right i mean i i don't think so i
i and like isn't it kind of exciting heavy hitters i'm about to
scale oh nice this guy's already in range 1527 is this guy in range
almost wait what it doesn't it doesn't skill
it okay almost and then i have a sho as well and i'm just going to three star shen kindred gnar i hit drad plus one i'm
back
oh
rolls let me show you darkness two
and yep curs that's not even like it's not
even good like what like three rolls i find two it's okay
also my gnar i don't know why this is even frontline this guy doesn't have a single healing item 141
19 i'm he's just frontline with zero healing i there's no way that's
right yon to that's okay what the kha'zix three the morelo morel
spark kha'zix
what oh nice okay not bad hp 53 it's
fine no no no just wait just wait like i i i'm scaling i'm actually scaling like if i can get four dry out in
targ okay how many do i have uh three six five four

oh that's
good let me show you darkness this is
necessary uh let me show you okay well i mean i can't go zero here i'm i'm actually kind of healthy though so it's
fine okay okay i mean what the is the game plan
here i i need some healing here i i need to start making my items like i if i go shojin then i have glove belt if i go
steraks like steraks hodge and just finish items i guess
so and then on carousel i just go for a tear
then okay f woil the
chase man the shielding from bt feels really nice though i need to make my items
baboom final ascension worthless your champion steal 75% for 2 seconds on
every ian it's not reaper crown uh like bab boom your champions deals
75% more damage on for two seconds on every other cast all right it like whatever
fck i was only going to go for h if i hit you today three i need a tear i mean
it's fine i i need a tear item here here or a spat and i also need to level to eight
for four
dryad okay like don't worry don't worry it's cuz my kindred has one item
just wait
all right it i'm rolling to 40 okay if i if i hit one one gnar before
i find one shen okay then i just don't go for gnar three or shen
3 but if i found like one more shen i probably would go for both i me i would go for both for sure okay and then tear
here i'm actually pretty strong
that's see worse oh yeah i can i can i can swap over but i'm probably going to level for another uh shu what the
it almost just one shot me okay what the was that damage though did you see that i think i'm about to get one shot
though oh man okay if i had blue buff i'm pretty sure this kindred is a beast
this rank bro no it's ranked i'm not playing this wait but this needs a blue
buff though like i'm not playing this in in what's it
called this pretty good though cuz now i
i can spike with the belt i can i can spike on seven with uh uh four dry out for free and if i can
make it to six dry i just instantly win the
game our wills align never a dull moment i don't even need or this
w and if i don't get d spat it's fine ghostly plus one i can just play six ghostly it's
fine i mean it's not like six go is not
nearly as good as four dryad probably or six dryad but like i mean if i don't hit like
whatever i's not even that bad
okay not bad this guy has his radiant item on
bench oh yeah g vol is terrible cuz he's your main tank but he i think he's s your tempo i
mean he took yeah i sound that good
peanut bunns thank you for the
prime oh i okay i really hope i win
this round okay is this guy fortune cash out he
must be right this guy's board is not looking
beatable well that's not good for me thises has one off of yoni
3 i mean i guess i don't really care about the cade
oh man whatever it work i have to make econ i can still
maybe hit sh
three our wills align

oh god my kind's about have zero items al i think i just lost econ okay i mean there was no tear anyway
i mean i could have went the thingy okay i stck one here and i just level and roll but
like i i got four dryad in but i don't have a third okay that's not
good i mean i can't i can't like what am i leveling rolling for this turn like like what i'm not rolling for
like i might as well stock one i i mean i have to like don't worry i mean i have to i have to wait four gh wait four
ghost is so good it's so much single target i have a one item kindred what the
please i mean i just four four dryad spiked i i need to actually roll for
some stuff it died instantly and i think if i fight if i fight this guy i'm dead for
sure oh sh three
the power of a dragon never a dull
moment a man oh wa there's i i can play six ghostly over over
something over what oh no i can't i'm just double
kayn i have a two item shen three i have a one item kindred 3 okay if i can make
it here like isn't it actually kind of good also i mean i mean i i'm starting
like to think i know it's not kaboom okay i mean it's
fine cuz like if i hit uh or and and nazir i mean on carousel it's it's it's
en counter right so like maybe i can make it let me show you darkness oh air
wait
what another ghostly unit the is here k2 is k
to uh want to send the clo this encounter okay if i can beat this i'm
back and i just dropped this worthless last six ghostly wait but who the i i can't even make it to nine like who the am i
selling oh okay encounter gives item like like
an item like a full a full item like or item like radiant item plus plus item
component okay defensive component i
mean that's pretty good there's a shojin is there an or no but there's a
shojin i'm a shun a shun
that is good and then even trout is even troud like like i mean yeah it is it's really
good it's really good and then i just i just
drop aatrox like bruiser for
ghostly if i find an or we are made by our
choices the last time i ate a plant was never
add and then if i can make it to this at i went out for sure like it let me fight this guy this guy's light work
he's actually light work i'm fighting him like what this guy's about to get cleared i just got six drad spike heavy hitters on a
kaboom he's his whole board's gone bye-bye this reminds me of our
first oh what's this it's a first
bye-bye gu w't spoil the chase and then uh like if i if if i can
survive until my third item on kindred bro i have a three star shen with like gigabase even shroud sunfire dryad shen
3 gnar 3 with healing like the st like healing titan steraks and then like like whatever like blue buff is better but
who the cares like shun guard breaker on a reaper like it's the same thing it's just basically jg okay and now all i need is one item on kindred i
win the game oh

i mean this guy's board is just a joke this is just
embarrassing oh man it's a first you guys talking to me
allawi what is this oh wait no no it's warden wait what what's wrong with warden it's really
good i'm not making top four really this guy's a fortune cash out i beat this board by the way if i'm beating this
board who the do i lose to exactly that's what i thought c d has 139 that's pretty good
okay i actually need hog if i want to fight him and win though honestly does if like if i sell
can i level one turn earlier i need to do the math like 41 60 it is one turn
earlier right there's no way i can greed leveling for this i mean it's only it's two bruiser who the
cares okay gs
hodge does does hj go infinite no i can just kill him bro it
has i mean it does but it's bro it has 3 3.7k hp if it dies it's
dead just
try holy
oh bye-bye all right one more turn i can get four
ghostly
in okay i don't want to fight this guy yet like if i fight him now i think i'm dead
i'm fighting him but like maybe there's
just a clone bug who knows like it void spawns don't even have hp oh they don't they don't what the
oh they don't oh that is
good okay i'm looking at this fight i i don't think i'm going to lose this regardless i'm not going to li
destiny halts for no
one heavy hitters on six dryad these are no dry attacks
oh this guy's board is just pathetic not going to lie i'm just going to put the
over here to try to uh bait out the nautilus to go this side and then just
leave these guys
bro he died in two
seconds was
never he died to my clone or he didn't die but he lost to my
clone there's another dry out plus one
but he didn't probo it was on his
side like what i mean i'll take it
up last
second ready for
this i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i actually d like this guy isn't weak but i'm pretty sure i dumpster him
that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first day
is l i mean
bye-bye it's all good fortune cash out got dumpstered peace


yay wait can you guys even see all right let me here let me put this okay oh oh this looks weird i don't
like looking at myself oh wait the okay and then oh oh
no no i did not drop it it's fine no no i dropped it like a meter or not a meter like like wait what
wait what wait do you guys think do you do you guys think i'm a crybaby or just like a justified
complainer like crybaby or justified
complainer oh i mean i see a good amount of justified complainers i mean i'll allow it yeah i am that good
like have i not like did i complain about any like like like encounter that's not just a justifying complaint
like it it's like bro oh my god it's so unreasonable like like this koga game
like bro what i'm playing a roll comp i'm just holding all the malou fights caitlyn's and cho gath and then like a
one goal to reroll your shop like i i i'm just up like 40 gold ahead of tempo out of nowhere like wow deer
three like where did that come from oh the encounter just won me the game four three
ah okay also i'm pretty sure this chogath unit is actually broken every time i hold
chogath oh i shouldn't have put this oh i don't have that much time but these going to kill him
faster oh cuz if i get if i get glove here i'm probably going to go this but if i get like ap i'm probably going to
go blue but i oh no i have time i time it's fine
oh bro these guys need to hurry up oh no
please oh thank god that the shop didn't like bug or something also i'm not used to my units selling for
gold fine vintage is fine vintage still broken
yes wait
really like is it more broken than one two 3s like it's it's fwn galaxy nah i'm
locked in today honestly i i think my game is is too easy if i just take this i'm sorry take that but i do think fine
vintage is still good but is my game way too easy if i take this it's f galaxy i don't want to attack
belt
rod a cog two on bench that can't be
right oh wait oh i can s on
uh i'm pretty sure i'm kind of okay with just committing to some zyra jen rolls i mean this
shit's actually good as i will not wa i missed oh i missed guinsoo plus uh guinsoo plus plus uh belt i mean how am
i supposed to know my shop is this i i i i don't
what do i want to play here oh oh oh what the
like is it's actually broken on f cuz i can just roll on six this is
green like if i can if i can roll on like if i can play my entire board on six is this com just straight up
broken i mean
probably none will escape my
grasp uh
bro i don't even know like my board is good but it's not that good and like like if i just low roll h it's fine like
chances are i'm going to win
rounds one darkness
whatever okay let me uh let me let me get my board it's uh jana
zyra
riven uh diana zoey sraa 1 two 3 4 five 6 i miss
it am i stupid
oh oh oh
ni you for okay i me i can just f my entire board in six like i mean you don't even
have to play sraa but uh i mean ri riven's better cuz
like the thing is you're going to cap around altruist so it's like like don't even bother holding this stupid ass guy this gall unit is a straight of
fraud like you can't tell me gallo is not a fraud
no uh like he actually is a fraud i don't
even know why like he he's like he looks tanky but then he just randomly just dies i don't even know what
happens uh i might as well just put items on this for now
three cost shain also are calling is lux better
than stupid ass ahri yeah probably okay i mean no one's playing
playing my comp right like honestly in fwn galaxy like isn't this comp just straight up broken like it has to be
like i can just i can fit everything on six playing lux i think i think yeah
yeah i'm tr i'm
tr oh
nice
darkness uh like i if i knew i was making 30 i don't know if it's worth it to
that's okay fun crown guard on twoos 3es like
like okay like okay if you were to go back right like is it on on two 3es better than fine vintage here like isn't
it just doesn't like my wasn't my game just way too easy like isn't this game just way too easy now the game's just like set up like i had a zyra like i had
the opener and then nash's tooth and then and now i can just three2 send it like it's actually just too easy like the game plan is just you can't you
can't even low roll
uh when do you go blue kale oh i don't really care about vertical uh story i i just go i like
going red uh red kale if i'm leaning towards
kaisa and i like a blue kale if i'm leaning towards like the ap backline oh man i lost my five streak i
honestly i'd rather lose the five streak this game is getting a little too easy
ian it was actually getting a little too
easy hunts you
today and then i'm just going to give natural too to whichever one i two are first
i'm so rich what the oh it's tear that's pretty good i
don't even know if i should be killing the rock cuz chain's like pretty easy to kill never mind okay i'm
try was a my items are insane this game holy
watch this do i even want heavenly odds
oh also it's encounter here like how do i know it's not just like some like roll like there's no way but
also i don't even want heavenly odds i roll heavenly plus one i i' rather leave the
game i'll just play another jack ah whatever i'm playing strongest like there's no way i just randomly roll
heavenly odds like it
how do you know it's not buy esp for cheap i don't i mean but i mean my game plan like i'm not just going to sack around for the off chance like for the
small chance like it's still better for me to not play around it because like i'd rather just roll i'm like rich as
you know what i mean like i probably wouldn't pre-level if it were this like if it were here but
like i'm not going to wait around that oh fea weights how many two do i have four
unified or was kind good i'm zoe what's your
name this is necessary i mean kindred to and i'm done rolling like kindred 2 is kindred
2 h it's not that good come
closer as you wish okay i mean this this word seems okay
for now i i don't want to roll too
much revone qiyana zyra
kaisa is that roll to
20art like 94 hp from this spot making 40 like this is kind of good
like it's acceptable if i had janir i'd probably just send it honestly like i don't even
know if it's correct to just remake cuz i i think zarra is like really good what three l all right roll your shop down to
one gold for three turns then i just i i just roll to stabilize and i'm just going to send it to like 20 here and
then i just win the game all right it york gg's york york oh alune also
works oh i honestly that help me more cuz i i i can actually roll for two stars this
one's
got hunts you viol violence as you
wish oh now now there's more reason to just send it i just putting those on here sure and then i don't really want
to find that though i'll just find this piece of also i don't really want to send the chain actually i probably
will okay i mean my board is should up un
losable
okay why is your hood oh this this hoodie is like a it's like s it was
$7 i bought it in in like 10th grade on black friday at like pon or some
it was straight it was like $8 it was $77.99 or
something but yeah i mean there's nothing around
that uh i go item eco i can just
go like rod is so good in this comp though i'd rather go item eo like like if i lose rounds like it's fine like i'm
not just going to make an item i don't need to like chain is like you can make every
chain item in the game and then rod you can make every rod item in the
game isn't this spot just straight up illegal making 40 like my board is stable as
and i'm like honestly you know if i were like if i were like 20 gold right now it wouldn't even be
bad my board is stable as
okay not 20 okay 20 would be like my board is it'd be fine i can probably still top four 30 it's probably
guaranteed top four but 40 i'm like i'm in like the twos like i'm in the twos range right
now p oh no invoker is like i mean okay is not bad but it's not like that good most of the time when you push levels
you want to start playing like the the good stuff like the uh like the alist like
rakan uh wukong like sage it's it's usually just wukong like your level eight and n is wukong and ran but since
i have fwn like i probably won't find it so i'll probably just play some invoker or something oh i be set on a n
streak i'm already on a two streak though so if i get set on a six streak
do i even make my money
back like if i win the round i get one gold plus three if i win i get one gold
plus one but get two like if i win the round it's just an unnecessary
risk cuz i'm probably going to start losing i'm going to start losing on
4-1 and honestly these guys are looking strong as so i might lose
anyway so say no no no cuz like i can still win like i i can still win rounds but i'm not like you just take the three
gold like three gold is three gold man like this guy took the win streak and i think he lost but like i break i break even on this round right but like
starting 41 like i'm playing a two cost three roll and it's not like i'm just going to send it to
zero kone will escape my
gras and this guy just lost three gold for free but like i'm like starting on 41
i'm probably not going to win every round right there's no way i want to see
everything fate hunts you today back
coming by your
command i probably will send it to zero like not send it to zero but i'll send it on like 4 five hey hello hello hello
i'm going for go three come on i am
awakened closer i i can also just move items i can also just move items to
uh uh i me riven three no one cares about this piece of
uh chain chain rod i rather i me i don't like this item but i can also just
move items let me see if brm's any good though like this bremble item actually oh wait oh oh wait it's not even bad can
i just put on the
run i if i don't hit n it's fine right like i'm just going to push after i hit like two two or two three
stars like three who the cares i'm going to st two more uh slow roll 50 if
i hit one more zyra i probably will roll a little bit more cuz then i i can actually just upgrade and just
push but then if i find more jenas i'm probably going to stay six cuz jenna 3 is also good uh capricious
forge i'd rather have team combat i have a rod to play around
capricious you have my bow forge crush test
i mean i don't even like any of these i don't like okay com is
good do know why i'm
rolling all right let's going lux
three eternal winter
wait what okay all right two more
rounds like if i if i hit z 3 early i'm probably just going to send it to uh if i hit z 3 early i'm probably going to
start pushing levels but if i find two more janas i'll just stay uh level six for like maybe like
two more turns like these losses aren't bad right like if i lose like i already saved all the hp i needed to on on stage three
i went anyway and then uh and then and then like i'm like after i hit three star everything i'm i'm pretty stable
then i like eight on midstage five or something i probably should have that he's any
everything oh man this guy's an eco too okay i mean i'm not hitting eco this is impossible to hit as you
wish zoe honestly zoe what's your name i don't really care they need go through
cuz now that i have five zo i don't even mind staying level seven and i can also just go for like zoe 3
doo carry instead of janna but like if it were non fond
galaxy here i feel like saka is like a relatively big spike for my board and then and then like post post neutrals
here like post carel here there's actually merit like if there's like zero zo gone right like wouldn't it actually be like it's probably better to just
level and sit and then like i'm i'm two zo's off i'm four zo's off two zyra off
so you can just roll on seven odds and then you're stable for two more turns and then and then like maybe you can just go for diana 3 as well but like in
fwn galaxy like bro i like i'm just sitting here 6 gig stable it's free as
yeah see educ educational streamer
uh there's a zoe with a tear i have a rod a
rabadons oh that's
gone i'm just going to finish the rabons prett good also i just realized this rod slam
on uh zyro was was a grief because like i wouldn't even mind just going
for alth i'm definitely i'm he going for j 3 it's
freea
to so like here this is the last informative thing i'll say so like here
right like if if you if you in a real comp if you don't know if you want to push or not right let's say i'm in a
spot where n is contested which it is and i see like two more
dianas i see like two more dianas and i have like eight zyras and like seven janna and i have
like five diana and diana's not contested instead of rolling on six still like you want to just roll on seven and just have faith that you're
going to bro i'm fighting him post cash out this game but anyway and then and just have faith that you're going to just hit the hit the two cost i mean
it's it's not that much lower odds you know what i mean and then like you can you then you can go for three start diana out or like sometimes or like but
like let's say diana is contested and like you can actually make it to level eight or like you already have like a woong just sitting on your bench which
is not possible on six but but if you did then like then maybe you just hit this like roll on six and then just start pushing to eight okay yeah just
use your brain like that i mean i i have so many z i'm just roll on six but i probably will go for zoe duo i
mean do i even want to make this like can i even hit nico three one two three he has three nikos on
bench what and this guy has three nikos like what the
what the okay and then after here i'm just
going to send it until stable this guy also has an eos okay i
mean there's no i'm hitting this i'm just going to move items but then i'm not going to have like a real tank a that's
lame i mean he's going to die soon but like i don't even know if it's worth
making i i'll make it if if i i lose this round or if i win this round it's
not even worth it i'm not going to h i'm not to go for the options i hit
saka s's pretty bad though with no items of the maybe we go like rien oh
yeah this closer just start holding ribons more f neary oh z three how many
do i have h but like here like i'm three jenna okay i'm going to
sc how many zoies are gone how many dias are gone like 1 two three
four five but he's going to die soon but i can't wait for him but i don't really want to roll for j i kind of want to
just push i just sold
the i kind of want to just push what am i r for i can just go on eight go level
to eight and r odds my front line is so it's actually so i this is
whatever this is 100 hp hold board i'll allow it i'm probably just going to double level to eight next
turn okay sh is good yeah sh is
good but i could also
just i guess five but he's going to die soon i think
i don't know i'll see if he loses cuz the thing is i i don't have to just go true zero i'm kind of healthy i can talk to more
right no joke i thought this is a content only stream but you have moments of being
very informative oh thanks oh two ler oh wait okay what the okay well okay i mean
sure i guess i just win the game for free okay well i'm definitely rolling on i'm definitely rolling on on here cuz then i can just three j and three zoe
for free let me see like how many is he holding like bro come on man come on sell the zoe like you can't even
hit you're leveling going to zero like sell the zoe what like what's the hold
up oh he sold them all right bet i mean now i'm just going to soll on on here for a
bit cuz now i can go three star diana three star what whatever it's called uh there's probably a better
bruiser i could be playing i i don't i probably won't go to restart saka cuz i'm not going to have
items but like i mean like this is just an example of an encounter just wouldn't be in the game like i was going to level to eight and cap around wukong and
rakan but now i i can guar i can basically guarantee jna 3 diana
3 zoe3 for not that much more econ like it just gave me 30 gold actually
it might be more than 30 gold
and then i can still cap around wukong in in in the thing but i just have to sack like two
rounds i'm not going ren
that so know i don't want to take i don't want to take a bad loss anymore
though re side 2 is re side two the power of a
dragon i don't want to use my ni here also isn't lent better than oh
it didn't make it okay isn't lent better than is it even better than rex ey hp
whole board also next turn i'm going to roll for one one copy and it's just a went
out i need one one more copy of diana or jana and then i try everything i probably could have actually win this
fight if i had actually it's not even close it's okay last
loss do i want zoe item or i want diana item i probably want d
item my front line is looking kind of
pathetic uh unless there's i mean there shiv
i mean there a full dclaw but it's a it's a one gold on it whatever it's too good rumble
dclaw okay
and i don't even know like this le it's not that good bruiser is so good right
no like you think r is better than le in or not is actually oh actually i guess now that this is my main tank the hp is
like not that relevant to have combat caster no i have combat caster never mind 100 that's one cast okay i
mean this game's over and then now i just uh sck two more rounds level to eight on i level to eight on 61 and then
i find that like i'm just rolling for one copy of rakan or ruk kong and uh yeah i mean it's
over like didn't these shos just win me the aim honestly it was probably like even without the sh nikos it was
probably actually correct to roll on 7 anyway of the dragon fury in instead of just gambling and that's not true cuz
like i can level and then i'm i'm guaranteed to be able to like hit like a two star like maybe like le 2 and like
silus 2 is probably the same it's it's slightly weaker than diana 3 but i'm i'm i spiked two turns earlier and spiking
two turns earlier is not even bad come let me show you darkness like i would be like 30 40 hp instead and then i'm
probably guaranteed top three oh wait yeah i don't even know why i'm so informant today like you know what like i'm not locked in like i you know i'm just going to go back to just relaxing
i'm getting tired

a i i i had to go middle and then move this here cuz my zoe is actually pretty oh actually no he moved this side all never mind it's actually perfect for
me this guyy is strong as though what the he's spawn is he eight archinist bro he's eight arcanist four
porcelain amumu 3 list 2 lux 3 wait this guy won the lobby oh
no wait what the is this
i'm like i'm not going fifth am i like wait what like surely i'm the second
strongest right like sur surely i'm the second strongest yeah it's the cash out guy oh
man i can level for invoker as well like rer to be seen
nah i mean i better be the second strongest like i mean can i play alune okay this lilia unit
is not very good annie 2 is probably better i mean i
can play silus 2 annie 2 gallo 2 wukong rakan morgana
alon two i don't know if i want to upgrade like aoon i
it let's move gallo
silus le in know honestly isn't bruiser also useless though i mean no one's playing this
or last time i to pl never oh i found a rock on it's that even that good
it's pretty good it's really good like i one the game it's
good uh guard breaker taa
i your you're cute
today i i killed a single unit he didn't so like if i 20 this
guy like if i 20 this guy right but this guy 20 oed me what does
that say about this guy's board
like what bro you just won the game for free bur of the
past eternal winter volley 3 six ghostly five ink wait this guy's board looks
kind of strong as well i think he's going to try to move
the etal winter here he didn't oh honestly i'm attacking
these two though so it's actually fine what do you want to do later i'm
i'm pretty sure i'm stronger i'd be surprised if i'm weaker than this my board is kind of illegal i'm not going to
lie oh bye-bye bye-bye oh what oh
no wait did he oh wait oh wait wait this guy's rock on too oh wait if i fight this guy i
might go third cuz no no no no no cuz he he actually has
s also if i hit wukong is that even stronger than anything like isn't it just my board my board actually
looks like it's between wukong or rakan usually but oh i just wouldn't play no
d's actually fine i feel like wuk better than i'm going to 1.5 i mean i it's
50/50 on oh how come i don't have perfect info i mean how the do i kill a single unit i don't think i
can i'm fighting real i'm eighth oh oh i'm fighting oh wait oh
fury okay i mean i don't even know i can i even beat this
guy i mean red buff is probably better like z unit is kind of fake maybe the
anti-heal like a guarantee like i like i like guarantee anti-heal i
like coming oh yay this is how dragon battle

well this actually looks pretty
good i think like maybe i can actually win this time it got it got okay the move was
actually dead i yeah oh oh i i need to kill him off here cuz i
don't think i'm going to win again and it's stage
six i don't think i'm going to win again like it's just luck like like i mana reeved it and then it got stunned by some like oh please
please like i mana reeved it and it was just about a c and then dord proed and then and then like i like oh please like
i don't think i'm winning this and then like my le just had like go like it just perfectly didn't get hit
by lux and then

okay i mean at least he not getting hit again that's pretty good
nice okay he got stunned wait honestly this is actually looking okay one more cast okay why does it look like i'm
getting 20 over this fight wait i don't think i
am oh bye-bye
bye-bye man

you know what i'm just going to order some ice cream i've never ordered ice cream before does it come like cold or

this nautilus unit is kind of a fraud
though but i mean it's free mythic like how bad can it be not that bad kayn i
can hold like a filios i aphelios is always like pretty decent though and it's not
like i mean i like am i really playing a dead i mean no one's playing koga on their board actually you know

this unit is op as three warden too
ghostly like zyra and cho like for anti heal it's actually kind of nice
amumu kaisa 2 okay but honestly this kaisa has a guinsoo do you think that does
anything wait mythic wait who are the mythics oh no but koga's good and then nautilus is is nautilus and then uh
or is or or not or is or cho is cho bro this like bro skinu kais that
does not do nothing spirits are calling
leave your journey or die in mine like i'm pretty sure i'm actually playing for
sniper backline with as much front line as possible it's not even

hey back okay i just got a shter nio like am i not going for a moo 3 i mean i am how
many mumo are
gone darkness

i'm just three star everything for free the game might be over
such a was no prison hold
me allawi three amumu three okay well this game's
over the last time i ate a plant was
never i mean i i don't even know if i want to go like i mean let me see like this guy's going to be holding gallo
plus the thing uh story champion duo carry on i'm not
sure 3 kayn kaisa plus the dude a bunch of ashe
holders h i'm kind of down to just uh level to eight and just sit and do nothing i just rolling eight odds i i'm
never going for this anymore so like i'm holding all this trash on bench for who the knows why but i mean i just
hack clear ben clear
mind i mean this game's over you can't tell me the shit's not
over what's up oh it's units in my shop cost three less i'm not going to bother going for this cuz it's my bench is

cost and i'm f going through tr
all right level for or next turn sit make 50 make 50 make 50 sack and i'mma
send it and three star every every four cost in the game
like kayn morgana are gone like kayn
morgana this guy's probably trying to play towards kaisa like gallo is a no-o which means syus is probably
also not that good they're probably holding ashes the
transition like mean i'm just holding not this ashe like all the like okay not
cane it doesn't

for uh who's my dual carry i mean seven heavenly so six heavenly units and then
i have three open slot rakan

y roon yon oh i have to play ahri actually oh so
it's just rakan plus one i mean umbral is
like okay honestly it might just be i mean it's wukong oh hold on let me just put it
okay give me a sec exalted for free like it's literally free
oh no r is good it's i mean it's for free you forgot to bow wait it's
good it's i mean it's straight up for free like like i get archinist whole board 20 ap and increased damage this
already is worth like a two star legendary and it's one gold okay nico
uh wait what qiyana
saka woong that's already seven heavenly 1 2
3 4 5 6 seven darius and have plus one oh it's just it's that easy just plus any legendary
this story is not
finished umbral is not that good i already i
already have seven heavenly behemoth i mean like yon for level seven i mean
it's not like i'm putting items on yon you fuing so i i i mean maybe i will i don't know see
items
oh a h as
well the hello watch this yes
where is this darus i alone myess hello where is this
darus hello my destination
is okay i rolled and i did not hit that is not
good for me al i could have popped it i mean that's not good i mean it's
fine it's fine i mean like realistically like come on like it's hitting two like isn't it kind of fast i mean i need to
go nine so like i can't just go zero i just have to pray i hit hit it
eventually i just have two
rounds harmacist keepers i mean keepers in com is kind of good good i already have on the from the
thing tiny titans oh there he is oh
bet my destination is
clear okay i don't even know why i'm playing umbral this is a
joke like reaper does nothing umbral does nothing and it's just griefing my
positioning oh minus four oh oh that's not
good oh man oh minus one minus
one i don't even want to sell cuz my next in i might just level for nico
then i don't know if i want to sam hodge it's not that good i can just go like redemption or something like itemizing
this piece of
n that is probably just uh like here i lose a gold for sure
but it's fine i'm probably leveling nest anyway
so y n in i mean what like what
why i just that
for oh man early early end of the game it's
kind of good it's so much hp is it is it perfect then roll
24 i have a glove tear i just go
redemption tear glove tear
belt okay and i'll go an i don't we tg or
something if i can't if i can't make it to like if my board doesn't even spike until i hit like all the good stuff like
once i make it to like everything i'm back like if i find one wukong i just win the
game but also okay i'm still
10 is you go with two hex range or nah oh no it's one hex wait what the
i didn't know that okay and now just afk probably eight on
four five maybe actually i'll probably eight on
four too zero gold sit nine on six i mean my word's actually
fine extra omnivan from uh the thing i probably just like 42 play saka
and then just sit and do nothing for an entire stage and then nine on
six five nine on 55 n on 55 just send it for wukong
rakan wukong plus one and then i probably will just do car
wukong this game it's pretty
good okay that's
boring no i mean isn't the darius good it is i had a sho five
darius oh no the uh the what's it called is broken like heavenly like your entire board is just
good for my darius just walked up and one shot the b of
air no i lost cuz i was level six and then this guy i lost to this guy who like i fought him when he had
cho three cloak three like no one's beating him man three at him
cog that was a fake loss i mean actually was a fake
loss i find uh i found one sraa
here and i just level and sit
bro their f i just lost a oh no and i think i sold
my ni i did oh no all right what do i have tear bf
glove oh man i don't have a saka i mean i'm not going to level until i find the saraka though actually i probably
perfect roll 28 38 in one turn it's or right now it's
40 i'm getting three per turn and it's not prf like go i mean i could just like go tear
glove bfbf i mean it's not like this only is complete and it's not
like probably going for uh just wukong items then
oh unified i mean i'll allow it the
oh man miss ni too coming
it
strongest oh man like if i if i have a saraka i would actually just level here
but like no saraka i might as well just say there's no way i'm rolling for it cuz highkey if
i don't roll for it i can actually kn on five2 or is it always kn on five
five i mean if i roll it there's no way i can 52 but but like let's say i i don't roll can i 5 to it let me i don't
know if i don't roll can i 9 on 52 does anyone
know i mean i like as long actually i probably can but i need to roll i mean i can probably roll
like bro this what the is that
on i mean i kind of roll like 20 gold like 20 30 gold is enough cuz even if i don't hit wukong i can still find other
stuff which is
fine bro miss ni too what the is
this moon is syndra too okay honestly this guy's
front line is it's this onear piece of oh wait oh oh wait wait bro he's p
okay i'm don't say a like oh oh i fight this i'm dead
as all right well not the kis oh great okay honestly i think my i mean my board
didn't really change either but neither did his i
guess who will be eaten first
you idiot team like come on like it just blocks the darius and then oh
wait oh okay never
mind pitching for no reason oh no i mean i mean there is a reason to also i
kind of need the saka it's a huge spike but i don't really want to roll for it
honestly if there's if there's no uh i kind of want an anti-heal item oh we go
g or go for like blue buff or something i i'm i mean it's fine i'm kind of let me see there's no yon players it's
actually kind of worth it to just roll cuz i can just spike off yon too as well oh there's no okay and then if i
hit a saka i'm done rolling only cls the future i also hit n to i just level the moment i find saka nik
to okay i hit yi too no saka okay well now i can't roll anymore where the
am i roll for nothing okay now what 32 to level i mean i can level but
then i lose odds for saraka anyway i mean i'll find the saka anyway ah nah leveling doesn't even do anything n i
will not hold back like i might as well just sit here
like i'm pretty sure i i can actually kn on 52 here i'll probably kn on perfect nal actually it might be
53 i'm not
sure well darus is a beast
oh actually no it's five it's probably five to that last until used i i might as well use use them on seven cuz i find
one sraa actually is that even true yeah i'm six freak it no prison
hello one saka please hello
saka please i mean i don't want to use gold to roll like come
on this game
man okay i i'll just say this i'm not look for any that oh this guy's or two now i probably lost my st but that's
okay uh 40 20 48 i'm getting an extra
two 28 perfect right now it's perf right now that means okay f2 is
perfect damn win for sure it's okay whatever what's my hp
66 saka get the past like it i i'll just roll for y3
no i mean y3 duo here is actually not even bad
and then i slow eight but the thing is i'd rather just level for s and level to nine but if i
hit yi 3 for free i'll allow
it or
die saka
saka i i might as well roll for one saka and then i find more okay i found this never
mind heav bless me about just zero next turn counter
no is it perfect roll next turn 60 70 68 68 i'm rolling
20 i mean i'll allow that i can go blue buff i mean i'm not going bt i
go protector v i can go blue buff i mean blue y i just piv it
to bro this darius is a beast one auto one
kill okay honestly like even though i can level here like shouldn't i just like i'm down like i mean actually i'm
rolling 68 i'm rolling i i have 25 gold and roon is a huge upgrade wukong
is a huge upgrade 25 gold like nah like i might as well just sack two more it's an extra like what i don't know
something what i'll just add to like 66 hp especially if if i have items for
wukong like wukong 2 is actually so valuable cuz my items on wukong are actually
good
uh okay but if my if my wukong items weren't
good here i'm down to just go zero like who the cares you just level and send it guarantee a top
three but i'm pretty sure like with these wukong items i can actually win the game like blue buff db hodge and
then i just go bro this darius just one shot his
entire board what the
okay okay my y need there 4.3 by the way and anti- healed his entire board that's
very
good the power of a dragon i mean but then if i'm sacking one then i might as well sack another
one cuz then it's perfect interval oh wait
oh wait no it's not no it's not it's not perfect r until 61 and now i'm just sending it next turn
like what the
okay oh man i'm fighting this guy again the
worst seven fated aphelios 3 i think i'm this bo's kind of
good oh whatever man also the or is giving
items to the thres like it's 10 gold maybe i can out
cap it's not perfect it's fine though whatever 51 i can i can probably guarantee a top
two if i just send it
uh heavenly plus one is there anyone i i even want to
drop no do no i mean like do i even want it okay no
i mean i did want it i think fortune blue buff jg
ramble these are all
i cannot see anything the sun is actually just straight in my eyes now
i can't see anything i actually
can't sck to the plan we have a plan oh that's pretty good i didn't find wukong though
oh actually it's it's going to be gone soon cuz i can tell it's it it like it was like in the middle of the window but
now it's like like if it's like five is the middle 1
through 10 5 is the middle it's at like 9 so it's gone soon
spiritual side i just lost 20 i could have just sold these two units what is
this all right where the is wukong legs are told honestly i i don't
even think i should go true zero here like if i make 10 here can i make actually i probably should not even
go like cuz if i make 10 here right like if i make 15 here one more roll like if i make 15 here like one roll okay no i
should i should say 14 cuz i go to 20 and then i go to 30 so it's actually like infinite
gold but i also don't want to lose this
round save your
long so much attack speed for the whole board
oh no it's just darius's uh though it's cuz the exalted is like like i i had five darius with the shito on bench
i rolled heavenly but heth so like there's a reason to play malite so like it's too
good like mal fight darius plus one and then ahri is free arcanus as well like is it just too good i mean it is too
good my journe is only beginning i how much omn does this have
not enough mango
moro actually does damage okay now what
i'll probably just roll zero on loss try to toar these guys that was beautiful baby this
reminds me of our first
days it was kind of close not really my muhong should probably be closer to the middle not sitting on the side like a
dumb remind me of our i don't know why my my like why is my rakan just sitting on the
corner i don't know we are made by our
choices we are made by our choices heart is empty without
empathy my journey only begin bro i saw six
show me
the just
try honestly i should probably just fing the wukong and just pray he can survive it's pretty tanky it's unified
plus the thing i mean that looks tanky as
and if i can survive this stage i can go 10 for i i probably will roll when i hit
the thing though

i mean this match up this dude has to be in the middle like the the rock has to be like somewhat
wa these two should be swap then actually it's
fine i looks pretty good to me wukong too beautiful baby this reminds me of
our first days
you're cute today it's probably just clone bug i'm not going to lie actually his augments harness this partial ension is
garbage forget the past it only clouds the
future people saying list forari can't be real oh trust me it's real don't worry about
it i mean i don't really want another moro i'll pretend like i want it though right bet maybe he like maybe he doesn't want
oh no he probably wanted it well actually i mean he doesn't want the i think he wanted the z but i kind of want
to just go 10 like sage is not even a small upgrade and like rolling for rock on oh what the a plan we have a
plan do i even i mean i don't really want to i don't really want to unroll this though i' go for a better
item how what is this what is this 20% crit is that
good 20% crit i mean i don't have reaper in
anyway i just put you got
it all right well if i can if i can survive these next two rounds i can go nine for sage and dragon lord that's
pretty good oh the sun's almost gone it's that like a 10
that beautiful baby remind of h oh
byebye i think this guy lost my clone
my rakan one with with with a bramble mello 4.1
he zia too
oh nice he c it again and
bye-bye three ties back in the pool i'll allow it oh nice he lost as well and zia
two perfect n stack one i mean stage plus the things is
actually so good but honestly rock on 2 is also good there like i like i'll probably hit is it perfect din roll
though i don't know how much gold i'm actually rolling it's it's 54 to level oh actually it is
perfectly noral 54 to level i'm rolling 20 gold on 10 one diana one z roon
dragon lord is whatever but sage is actually huge 12% on
man not my fault they should have b i have the as
well ap what is this hp oh wait i don't have anti-mr right or
armor
right wait right like these these guys don't have anti- armor i'm not stupid i
don't think so
great my rock's on the wrong side i'm an idiot oh never mind he moved into it all right bet never mind
i bro this rakan oh my okay didn't this even shout just like
turbo spike me like it wasn't even close like he had so much armor and mr and
then i didn't have anti- armor and they just it just gives me a even trout i'm back


all right you know what honestly this doesn't even look that bad if you just don't put the scores it like like does
this even look that bad like what's what's worse this like when when when you don't include the the scores or or
that like it doesn't this just look way worse like honestly this doesn't even look that
bad oh bro that one's too easy it's actually too easy york's also in the
set ni go this story is not yet

finished what the is this oh oh is wait what
no one is promised
tomorrow stand
coming sorry i don't want to look at chat cuz i'm going try to give it away but i i need to give me a sec
i need to play my other game real
quick none will escape my
grasp wait what the oh i didn't know it was loot sub wait no one said anything oh honestly this is kind of
good i just got altruis plus altris plus story what the is this wait
what i alone inside my fate this world needs
hope uh alterist

bro what the even is
this what's a champ it's i mean i know it's not as let just keep zooming
out why does it look like like the mythmaker skin like that's like like wait what you know i'm just going to keep like this random champ like
i'll find it eventually whatever i give up i try my
best of the what
chath oh wait why does it look like a mythmaker skin oh wait oh it's right here wait what the

oh my bad travel awaits okay i'm pretty sure tom
catch is better than something a it is okay my bad my bad i i'm trolling
like i okay i like no it looks like a mythmaker irelia
no like it kind of it kind of looks like this this art as
well it's the same color scheme also i'm pretty sure if i play tom keni i actually could win this fight
actually do i win this anyway who is letting this cast again come on come on please
please you i could have won this fight oh
my this world needs hope i okay honestly i don't even know
if this is stronger i mean no it's it's stronger next turn so like it's fine also i'm never playing vertical story that is a grief i'm
no
idiot okay but also how do i just hit altruist story weaver is that even
allowed altruist story by the way is this is this totem full random or is
there like preset ones like is it like exalted or is it full random cuz i swear i see this one like kind of
often oh it's full random oh
really i feel like i see like the same combos like maybe i just play too
much cuz i remember a nico ano said like
how are you not bitching about this emblem by the way and it was his exact one
well that's i'm just playing towards uh i'm just playing towards kais zia back line and you just flex the d front
line go i'm going to go chain it's uh it's it's probably it's probably the best uh what's it called in the game
like or like like if you have if you have altruis like you can just flex all that garbage for
free and then now i find one saka and i get get uh three altruist plus uh plus
uh heavenly with the nico i go where the trouble
is ian it's not like mythic does anything but like my spot this spot is you know what i also helps me the fawn like the fawn is basically like
a giga fon because i'm playing i'm playing towards four altruist so so my extra unit is gaining an extra what 40
it's going to have an extra 40 armor mr and because i'm playing the altruist saka is an altrus which is a
heavenly and uh and rakan is a is a is a altrus which is a will be eaten first a
dragon lord so it's like this spawn helps me a lot more than other people because i'm playing like the team buffs
i'm playing dord i'm playing altruist i'm probably going to be playing sage as well so like this this
spawn is actually like i mean it's way better for me than other players like it's already like my abp like not only
this totems already low like ap low threes but because of this fun my ap is in like in the twos
youness bro no one asked hey this guy
said he asked lost i mean i would prefer to lose
i mean if i keep winning the games the game's way too easy like what the i mean yeah i mean if you keep winning
right like isn't the game just way too easy like right now like the game is actually just too easy i might fall asleep soon let's move i've got
people
to this is
necessary i have an i have a dead whatever the this is in
i probably should have just open sold this for chat 2 is chat 2 this is actually
broken i mean sage is sage how bad can sage
beone will escape
my and a rel
as you
wish dragon lord sage i need to go back and find garen i
have a fawn i'll just find this on this piece of
all right sak please chain worthless probably one of
them oh never mind it's not that useless something not that useless i am
that good all right saka please

gra is your
home i me
dord i go where the trouble is
invoker trick
shot i if i hit story weaver plus one here all i need is is a spat and i'm 10
story for free like like it's sp or a and i just
hit and then i'm just 10 story for free and i just win the game for free that guess fortune 2 one bruiser plus one radiant relics bulk
honestly bulk is not even bad from this spot especially on alist baboom new recruit double golden
ni i get another fawn honestly like how bad can new recruit
be i mean bulk like it's good but it's not that good like it's good i i'm buffing like some
but this also gets buffed it's pretty good i'm playing like all the good stuff
invoker trick shot another r
little get heavenly and cuz i'm playing around i'm playing around heavenly sage dlord all that
i have two golden eos the first five cost i see i'm just about to just double nco that
and i'm probably just playing vertical like vertical
heavenly four altruist dlord sage oh this g is just over the
i can also just like four like four five and just go for a three star for cost i only only need seven
copies two fs melight nico i mean next i can get aran but like
how do i not find an arist it's impossible not to i can find any arist any invoker any
sraa any lein any rakan okay i'm not finding that but but
yeah what board did i play last game i played uh kobuko fast n into a or fast
10 into like a giga
board it was like kobuko haia
real all right can someone kill this stupid ass shen for me like what's going on here oh oh nice
good good job kale i mean if i didn't if i didn't win
this round i probably would have rolled i probably wouldn't level to seven so honestly it might not be that good cuz how do you know i don't level to seven here to maintain streak and then and
then i get hit with the whatever the that is but also i don't even mind slight rolling here my board is pretty close to
being upgraded three pairs but i i'd rather level to seven and
roll uh last wh bf is good i level to seven here and just slight roll a little
bit i can even roll to like 10 32 i i all like to 10 mali 2 dragon
lord lux
invoker i i am sitting on four pairs but these pairs are not real i one zoe is basically a fwn cuz i
can drop this and the once rock is a big upgrade
i just 20 this guy i have 10 units including if it you to
include this c coun yeah but i didn't i didn't really uh i didn't invest that much right so like it's fine i i think i
only pumped like maybe like i only lose 10 gold it's like but then i also like yeah i'm not making that much one right
now so think z worth playing around cics you
just start bitching when it does hit i mean zek's back line is my back
line even strong lock at front line it's not it's not the front line that's the problem cuz my back line does
no damage also i'm down to main like to main streak here one rock is a huge upgrade i can drop five ass
story weaver there also sage
no sniper anyway i just drop invoker three
alst wait is this only three
turns what's exalted rexi senna yor amumu syndra trash
deny me no longer
nico riven
civer all right rakan
please a sho i am
come
closer there's a zonas a dd honestly a dd front line triforce
front line i mean it's probably not zonas i mean i can triforce front line it's
actually pretty good i mean am i ever playing nico this game
maybe honestly i kind of want to dd like the tri force i already have so
much armor on a mar it just goes infinite half the time but i don't really want to dd these
units these things are too by way i'm talking to here right
also i probably should be making some items i just realized h whatever if i wait he's 50 gold is he's
50 oh i thought it was t too holy do i want
this i'm
probably like i can go gs plus protectors v already oh
sorry the problem is i'm carrying a a zyra but i probably want to
sack too i mean sage crest and i just go
vertical sage as well like with all these spawns like honestly it's kind of good wait dlord i can go five dlord
as well that's even better vertical sage actually wait hold on sage or or
vertical dlord i what does sage do ap backline but i have ad it's
dord everything must go from this spot honestly like is everything must go
even that good i mean have two golden
eos like isn't even that good
you forgot to bow wait what was the
loot hly it i just i just put items on my gallo
oh no okay i an internal winter okay it's fine
i have to uh i have to sack the stage though or i'm not going to sack the sage i'm probably going to level in and restabilize in a turn this world needs
hope i just attck one and then i'm going to level restabilize and then like it's
fine me go to i mean i have to find a new gallo
though i'm eternal winter here unless i want a eternal

winter man honestly though it's kind of boring like like honestly everything in mus go is broken here but it's kind of
boring no cuz like this game this game would have been really fun like i could have played like five dlord and like
flex like a bunch of carries but now i'm just playing for three star for
cost but i feel like three star for cost is like it's it's like you can do it pretty like easily with everything must
go but oh this is a p cash out honestly i don't even know i beat this guy but uh but like now it's like yeah three star
five oh i won't have enough money i have to level and stabilize here
so i i don't just die for free
oh
up 2 come
closer zoe what's your name i no one else play that j
or i mean no one's playing this right the long time i had to pl was never some
call me evil shall i prove them right i going i have all these items
should i just put it on here i'll probably not play nico eventually i defin play zoe gs last whisper i mean am
i just putting all items i i just have all these items just sitting here let me roll to
10 okay kaisa silver lilia silus
morgana 2 is morgana 2 i i'm probably not ending the game with half of my
bored like mal fight is what hp armor and amar kaisa is kaisa

last whisper gs db
every flower blooms to be seen i'm a eternal winter just
sitting here doing nothing i can go like zoe
over over nothing i no one's playing seven story that is a grief but
also i mean okay kaisa i mean there's like too many kaisa players like there's no way i'm hitting kais 3 but i can hit the other stuff
so it's fine they were so
close a spot violence to end violence

i go mythic plus one i mean tear bf
belt honestly even though if i have sunfire i'm down to just make a morello also
like i don't even know like i down to roll like the 40 like i don't even know how much i want to roll here i'm like not that close right play around this
bad have fun 42 hp
i mean i don't know all i know is i'm carrying a kaisa one and i'm about to go morg 3 like this unit
sucks i don't know what's worse morg 3 or lilia 3 which one's worse i'm going to
send morello three is worse oh
reveal our way we must press
on no prison can hold me the power of a
dragon hold to 20 i just missed the more oh that's not good oh i also need to buy
the spong like le in i'm definitely playing ashe nautilus gallo there's no
hit in this yeah my journey only begin i mean i'm probably just going to play towards ashe no all one more roll i mean
uh like le to don't call me evil shall i prove them right i don't even have much
gold left oh i might die though oh
wait some call me evil shall i prove them right we must press
on i'm coming for
you vertical stage some call me evil shall i prove
them right oh into the dark
oh i'm out of go now what
also have a ni on my board
yes i mean three dlord is also
useless i there's a spark but okay i mean oh okay i me okay that's
okay like i can just lose like okay like vertical like d's not that good unless it's four
i mean it's all right not really it's not that good my front line is
trash i don't even have a sniper on my
board and then i have an extra i mean i can go mal fight i mean nautilus 2 over let me read
it's more damage and a little bit more attack speed i mean nautilus 2 is not even that good though
like but also like what the does what's it called do no prison me i mean
it's not like cyber is terrible but like ah like up
helios like i can go like naos amumu thought it was just a har n
aumu like like
cyer but i mean no lilia like this is just not good lilia flow bl to be
seen the power of a dragon set

every flow bl to
be why you still rolling because i can't go nine how can i go nine from this spot
these unit sell for zero i'm at zero gold i'm at four
gold and my board's not good like it's not good at all i have a dead le in dead wukong dead
aios like vertical sage isn't really useful but the heavenly attack speed is not terrible

i can play i can play
kate and you thought it was just a harmless
breeze
sp come closer
spirit reveal our way i kind of want to play a m
no uh it's not like that does anything either my board just sucks and i think i'm just okay with it sucking my
board is a pile of all right no joke
no
prison one life though he's holding notilus and
lilia is he playing ashe i kind of want to roll before
spirit reveal our way how do i play how do i play a
mooo it's not that good though like like surely
sage like i it's it's probably it's probably over this stupid ass le like like like 3d lord
yeah i can also just lose the sniper but i mean like sniper is not terrible it's actually a lot of dps my front line is
it's like always sniper value it's not like ashe is nothing it does
nothing this ashe flow to be seen and one
roll i can't hit nautilus he's holding one lilia zero ashe a zer

two bro i can't like i like bro they sell for nothing i can't like here like
i'll sell like what could i not hit nautilus oh that's weird
also i don't know why i sold that because it took one out of the
bo holy almost
lost except oh ashe three with heavenly oh bet
okay well i mean ash3 like surely i play sniper i there's no way i'm not playing sniper with
ash3 all right where the is sniper any snipers the last time i ed was
never legends are told in word and all wa

that's what it's kind of good it was actually kind of close transcendence is never
guaranteed i everything must go augment is so broken like i just don't get it i don't get it


player standing one enemy
remaining this cross play there is good though i'm going to go plat this guy's aim is not silver like
come on no no no no this nah like this guy is not silver like emily wing is silver like hold
on this guy is the same rank as actually i think emily wing is gold now like
there's like two more mid there was like two more one
window oh one
window oh like come
on a a 4.8 yeah cuz uh bad players like yourself take it
no
disrespect hello
do you remember your deal 20 hours or 100 subs what

the i have two removers for free the
exalted is wait does doesn't this actually guarantee hatch if i play too
exalted wait it does right darius kobuko when life gives you sour cle yeah
what the all right bet i get a guaranteed
zyra i mean that's pretty good oh another another
z this world needs
hope why do they give me lucky paws oh no

my items though belt chain bow ah whatever man like it who
cares life is good come close okay i'll play uh i mean should i even play
bruiser or should i just start farming gold with exalted honestly the exalted
oh but also like i kind of want okay it's encounter here of
the i mean like sunfire bow and then i go for cloak cloak or tear on carousel
it's half redemption half bro this augment is actually so
broken it's just uh i only have one i only have one kobuko so it's not even that
broken but i mean it's still broken
but like uh like my items like i have no redemption components no deault components oh wait
oh cloak cloak cloak cloak clo yes yes yes yes yes i'm back all right where
the are the kabos all right and now i have three kobuko dclaw spark i'm back but also like
i don't even have to roll three are i mean i i'd prefer to but oh man i mean that is good

uh i'm have two i'm just cloak it like spark's really good and i'll go for redemption on someone

else great i'm fighting a dclaw thresh titans titans bt kobuko greater
than okay i mean how like okay i mean do you see my items yeah thanks for nothing
living oh so where the are the kabos come let me show you
darkness i have four like i'm about to just push levels
one
two 3 four five oh
man this is the
worst wait if he he kills a unit wait he can auto attack kill it and
gives a gold wait really of the
past what the okay this okay this al is
broken cuz i was you know i've been playing kobuko roll without this augment and it wasn't even that bad my
scores are like 855 but like i was playing it like like hard
forcing kobuko roll with with no that's why you go titans it's not even better you idiot like
oh my like i don't have okay not only do i not have like what i i
sorry sorry
okay and then now i need a redemption but honestly if i don't find any uh if i don't find another kobuko i'm
just going to push levels to bow it's not worth it for me to just sit here like i already have riven 2 aatrox
2 what's bisuko sunfire spark dclaw redemption bramble uh i don't think garo is that
good i don't think it matters like you just put like you just put your items on him and call it a day kobuko
three items it's probably different with lucky claws or whatever the it's called the
spark ramble dclaw redemption sunfire my garo is like kind of okay i guess steadfast and warmog n actually let me
let me put lucky paw i mean either way i don't think it matters like spark dclaw redemption
sunfire like look at these noobs that are just sitting there greeding titans titans bt and you wonder why you lose
every game because it doesn't do anything
i think i just lost 30 cuz you sit there and you greed your
your your so-called abys and by the time that you actually
get the items online the units already
outscaled like okay like i mean you like you get like a gold like so one gold early game is is a lot stronger like
like a lot it's just better and then the thing is it's like wow congrats you farmed one gold on stage for like it doesn't even do anything like sure your
kobuko might be stronger but you already lost so much tempo that it's not even worth
it but also here like i'm i'm about to just uh i'm about to just ditch this stupid eso just use it for
tempo i mean i haven't i haven't gotten a single kobuko but i already like won the
game from this spot i don't even know why i'm hold
b yeah i have four wait now i have five they call me jolly they
right okay if i natural one more i'll roll for it

come closer will you put up a good fight oh i
had natural one that's unfortunate
i mean it is
unfortunate what are the exalted darus
kobuko okay i'm just going play towards ka bad i mean bro i mean wait what bro i
i i saw one kobuko the entire game like i i can't roll like you can roll if you i mean i
have eight ro to riven too like what the am i rolling for only like i'm rolling for for four kabos that's
it i'm stacking an entire stage and just and losing 50 gold for four
kukos when i can i can just tempo the stage and i can just spend 50 gold in roll for like
kaisa the other
capricious silus is actually pretty
good oh unifi is really good

he just loads in with that i'm fighting him man like oh my i will not allow it why did i say i'll
allow it's like oh my and then now i'm fighting him like i honestly i'll allow it cuz the
thing is he he was threshed through this entire stage and i just dodged him so it's like not even that bad
reminder that soju visited sey before testing bellum good morning today pinned by bellum wait what no i was watching no
i was watching i was watching sarah play virtue of the martyr some other
garbage what was it the gem on on her vender sentinel and just walks up and dies every round and then after she died
she went to c's chat and i jo and then i went to cal's chat as well like wait what anyways i'm for one s it also like
come on like why i fight this guy this not is emp what empathy
what let's move i 5050 i mean i i actually want to hatch
the okay so you're telling me i'm just going to sit here heavens
bless and play this pathetic ass board so i can hatch kobuko 3 i try not to
stop teer tear tear finish them no prison can hold
me okay i'm i'm just going straight to nine it how many turns do i need four that's not even a lot
six bruiser three story items on a cver one nothing all right kobuko and i cap around
kobuko saka and lilia
oh my god it's all i'm scaling i'm actually scaling you got a coule goat i mean it's
actually fine i don't have to start that many rounds yeah good one go now it's a
titans titans bt
diff bigger and
better uh i can actually cap around
like magic wand and then i just play like h with what are the
exalted i mean i can definitely play exalted this game magic wand but there's no way this is not like
i i c ed here all i know is i have three items on a
civer one two three four like i dropped down the four
bruiser i dropped down the four bruiser mythic with h
lilia maybe air i don't know i just have all my
items on a super one like that can't be right
for isn't losing this kind of embarrassing yeah i mean i'm not not going to lie it is i mean wait
what lilia kobuko saraka get some better units on the
board maybe i play kaisa with my last db kaisa zia saka
rakan do i just drop the two bruiser kobuko plus
i i don't even know who i'm supposed like i have a whole board kobuko plus ribbon i mean all i know is my entire
board is trash that's all i know like this is just
embarrassing all right whatever
it tear rod kobuko
lilia sraa this kill doesn't even do damage to
goo and bye-bye wait hold let me read this does
it scale off his hp or is it just heal ne oh it does scale off of
hp i have spark already tear i have a blue buff like wukong i mean i'm down to
just go fast 10 like rolling for what well actually i should probably try to play as stupid ass
ever last db tear rod tear
rod tear cloak rod tear rod archangel play
around tear adaptive play around
rod oh one more turn all right bet
i mean it's not even good i'm like missing a lot of hp right i'm missing like what eight plus 5 40 hp a turn it's
not good i mean it's
not i'm not playing mythic with
that okay tear
then sell it nah oh no this ch about to on my
kobuko i'm pretty sure cyber focus is like whisk cuz look at his front line if he fights any confident board
his front line just dies instantly i mean like look at the cn's focus value it's straight up worthless i
think my kabuka might just one one the shen for free okay there's no way a
man i mean it's
fine what is this i don't want wait what i don't want
give them free loot i'm trying to go fast
10 54 honestly i'm kind of down to just roll little my board is not very good
a the dude three above let's move i've got
people i i might as well just wait one also like what do i want to hatch
irelia maybe i don't even know if it's possible
for me to hates zia go here
i guess i have another anvil as well it doesn't really do anything though okay i'm not to just go fast 10 like 54 hp
like it's fine this is a demon regardless but i don't i there's no i'm
ending the game with six bruiser this is a joke
oh ab is not bad though as you
wish i mean is there any way i can hatch cuz right now it's hatching a way honestly i don't even mind hatching the
way like who the cares it's not even bad man okay and then i'm going to move the blue buff off eventually i mean i'm going straight to nine
i have i i have all my items on a silver one no synergy okay i should probably hatch on irelia or
something like come on like there's no way i'm i'm just sitting here going fast h civer one
carry oh
no win oh isia leg oh hatch irelia wait what
oh wait oh oh i guess artist doesn't count okay okay that's pretty good okay i mean it might it might even
ending the game with this stupid ass probably not all right you b bow
tear blue buff zia to the plan we have b b i mean i have red buff but the thing
is i i not red buff i have redemption is way too good no matter what i'm going redemption belt tear i mean i'm still
just going to go red buff it's all good and then you know what blue buff way it's not even that bad i'm not reforging
anything okay irelia red buff last whisper db and then i have another one here
maybe play list eventually honestly wait is is this one seven turns as well or
no this this one is seven turns
really okay you know what i'm just going to paint this and then i'm just going to buffer it until i get this one and i paint the full one assuming i make it
there all it's whatever it
and then and then one two two three four five six and then six one i i hatched
the full fight and then i'll probably play alyssa and then i'll pop this
eventually all but also okay do i just 10 in two turns uh i mean no matter what i want to
play around saka plus sraa
rakan lilia
uh do i have mythic lilia i mean i want to play tom kench if i want to lilio
way i me i could just play tom kench or am i playing
jenna maybe i'm going fast 10 it's fine
bro this way is a beast or not h sorry's useless
the kobuko is a beast
to but i will finish them
monsters are am i playing or i mean i probably always cap around orer this unit is just broken as i mean i can
also cap around kaisa plus i mean i'm probably playing rakan since i'm playing saka so the kaisa i just end
theia i might just level and sit i'm dropping like no one cares about
dryad no one cares about this piece of i mean riven's fine this is fine this is fine one two three gone for
tk 1 2 3 4 open slot to tk sraa
roon lilia so i'm not playing orer unless i
want to drop gallo plus gallo plus riven for or new deer
honestly i don't even know if that's
stronger your tear
and bro
what okay there's a shin uh gum blade worthless
all right it steraks kobuko instead of instead
of i mean i kind of like i kind of like the spark like instead of sunfire yeah like i kind of like the spark but
honestly like isn't the sunfire like how much armor is it 20
i mean it's so much
hp i want the spark on it
always okay this shit's like 2k h
okay never mind it's not even it's not even taking dam i mean but it's fine like it's some part is the same it doesn't even take actually what does it
get to let me see it's 6.4 right now and it goes to my entire board is
dead oh 7.3 i that's pretty good to my whole board's gone i mean it's fine
38 saraka syndra lilia jenna i'm probably never playing this
yeah heavens bless me
okay sak more one two three gone tom kench
saraka rock

lilia pre resulted free mythic pr do
how is this to kill anything here this has double dclaw oh what the how much does it
do 1.3 * 2 oh but my my sunfire like my red buff okay it's fine it's fine no
don't worry don't worry it looks like i'm e just wait bro it's not a sunfire diff like my my irelia died like
it's still antiheal like come on it's not going to just walk up and kill eight units like it's fine
21 heartart is empty without empathy this is how dragon
battle i channel the spirits i feel closest to what does lilia look like
let's move wait am i missing lilia here it's
it doesn't paint on neutrals don't worry i might as
well are told in word and deed
hello every river ends i miss rakan oh sorry sorry it's okay it's okay i i'll
find them like i'm level i'm level 30 it's fine it's fine it's
fine all right that's my last loss i'm getting two full items here i'm back
are you having spot over there what do you want to do later oh man i think i won it's not even exciting i'm not even
one life boring final sight boring put up a good
fight no it's actually is boring all right bet it's lit hello you
ready for me okay so we're doing this



ah whatever you got it hly wait why don't i just rege the
last too easy beautiful baby this reminds me of my destination is
clear i
i mean you know the game's over when i mean this is the same thing as farming one gold
oh i herald the
greatest it's just so boring

boring like whe with irelia like oh my god the way just tickles the backline and just kills like four units for fre
i was going to wait until to pop into carousel cuz if carasol has like a components i can just see cheese as a component right like let's say a glove
then i would just take the glove

i just wanted to tell you i've been a long time viewer and in all the time i've watched you you truly appear to be in peak form your decision- making is
legendary your general game knowledge shows your profound wisdom a true tft sage the entertainment value you provide
can only be described as heavenly in my opinion you are one of the greatest streamers on twitch these unique traits
you possess are almost impossible to come by it is as if i if wukong himself was playing shut the up like oh my
god come on don't level to seven on on stage three when you're playing roll is
because it's actually like more gold like a lot more gold on seven to roll but like sometimes you still want to level to seven if you have like you can
make 30 or you can level to seven even even with 40 and then roll a little bit to stabilize cuz it's okay for you to
stay on level seven but he full streaks stayed level six to play a fast nine
like does that does that even like i'm actually in i'm actually in disneyland low like like from now on like i i need to lock in this is just
sad like i'm just getting so tilted i don't even get tilted at anything else like i can just turbo my units i don't even care when a player
like is that bad and i get griefed because of it like i'm just like man like i don't even know like what's going on like like you think anyone else is
going to sit there and hold three b three tras and and just play your like play it on your final board no any competent player is never going to do
that so i don't expect him to do it but like i'm just sitting here like okay well
okay this world needs hope

i'm in bellam wait she's talking about my skin wait what i know where the trouble
is oh my skin's good solid warm up who's next it's
cute this world needs
hope tattoo of protection
bombardment this story is not yet
finished holy i need to hold that enter the dragon yay your max interest is capped
at three gold but you gain two gold at the start of every player combat honestly like that into a mal
fight chogath game it's not even bad not really i mean you kind of want combat and also i don't really want to
play this in in viewer low because i'm like these guys just s oh that guy's ghostly plus one okay i
mean i'm not like healing orbs no combat caster cluttered mind i mean cluttered mind into a fast n it's pot of gold so
it's not even that good but it's fine i mean no one's taking that mulched yeah okay buddy not
stupid i will not p
her of the uh i'll just go shred this guy's a
riven too
okay so if i can't go fast n from this spot what's the game
plan oh okay well i'm guaranteed fast n it's over i got an
allawi
uh okay i kind of want to hold this all the jana i mean already this thing plus this it's kind of expensive to hold
exed is oh or nellia
exalted i mean that's kind of good okay i mean i'll always play r or
and irelia i mean these units are
broken or irelia exalted i can pre level to five
here let me make sure i win this fight first i'm just going to make
10 i going win this fight i don't think so goodz i didn't
pre- level actually low key yeah not really
this one's got
fire i'm pretty sure with that i'm never playing the uh the fated opener i can just start selling some stuff like sell
this for cosics i jau is actually fine is jasu better than elaoi
one uh probably no ghostly
sh honestly his bo's not even that good he doesn't he he can't make an item he doesn't have a single item slam like his
board actually looks like it just looks good cuz i think shen s is just broken but honestly he doesn't have a single
item slam oh man okay you know what i lost round but
i yes okay i kill one more and i kill his minus three
rat first i'm silver and i think i got this
set fure i'm averaging 111 if you want some coaching i got you yeah you on me or
what you're the same elo as sarah bro she's she's in soju high like or soju
low or soju high yes okay like these
backline these guys don't even do anything all right illaoi over like like the garen
exalted teo amo caitlyn
aos like sur there's something better than than a cer on my board a guar to organist no thanks also
why the do i am i not gargoyling what is
this
thank you i was about to say i was about to start complaining i'm not going to
say was
kate kate ahri ahri rone kate
katei a ro civer civer kobuko ahri make 50
or make 20
pre-leveled bro this spot like if i can make it the fast n bro like or
irelia
i don't even who even is the last one i
play lux l uh like lux oh
my honestly is there anything wrong with playing garen and like garen orelia like it's
not even that bad
i i don't really want to play lux this unit is not that
good come let me show you darkness
you can clutter on
neutrals bow oh bow that's pretty good double bow
such a waste i'll just show you hey see look it didn't cloak all right
in darkness we find
ourselves okay i am going the fastest nine i am actually going the fastest
nine like like what is going on here red buff
bombardment uh okay last item i mean this is half shun half cloak
item but honestly ly like one bt cannot even be bad it's actually it actually can't be bad and like is there an encounter no like whatever
it like i'm just committed to going fast n also i wouldn't even mind like rolling a little
bit on eight like you can't tell me this is not
a bt diff you can't you you cannot tell me this is not a bt diff your
bulk warden crown what the is this
come on i don't want prismatic
here a warden emblem of redemption in a gnar a freaky
friday trash the treasure my items are fine like it like tiniest titan
like bro like no like i already have cluttered i mean i don't want to take
bulk i'm not taking accomplice y i guess i'm just getting
more gold i think i might be eighth i'm just going straight to 10 i
guess but i have i don't have a single combat augment oh
no
ours oh sh i think i won again all right bet i'm kind of down to uh just play
fortune just lo streak
fortune fre oh know freaky is not that good like like triforce like it doesn't really spike my board like i would be
tri forcing like a jax i'd much rather just take hp and and gold cuz if i make it to the final board like it doesn't
really matter at least two gold here who the
cares guarante two i'm kind of down to
uh like i'm going to be losing really soon and then whenever i can i i'll just
like lose streak all the way until 5 or 41 but i'm pretty sure with clutter
mind i can go fast 10 bro i think i won again
how so oh no no i want to hold the uh i'm holding the fortunes cuz it's like
i'm going to lose i mean i mean i guess i mean items are pretty good red buff bombardment
gargoyle like bulga is like really good later but it doesn't like spike my board or like it doesn't like it doesn't spike
my board right now so it's like either like i either take that to scale but then i sack anyway like i might as well
just sack anyway you know yeah i mean i need tgs to scale i
need a shun to scale tear i need one tear to scale or i can't play the game
like one shun to scale red buff on irelia is fine bt on wukong is fine i need to
yeah okay let me see
yasuo it rolled a six oh honestly should i just play it not this turn but next
turn hopefully i lose this round so i don't feel nearly as bad and then i just i just lose all the way
until 51 cash out gg's
yeah in darkness we find
ourselves and i lost but i mean like whatever the fact that i even i'm on this five streak is so fraudulent
like like i like i'm just down on prismatic and you're telling me i just five streak for free
really i that's fine with me hp is
hp honestly red buff bt i know hp is hp it's
fine wait oh i thought i sold my tro holy what is this bombardment
which
three these three i'll rem make this as well it i rather just put all three on
here honestly i don't really want to bt my
light no prison can hold me
all right bet level
six i mean that's
fine three in a loss who the
cares
your spirit take it if you
can
the solid war up who's
next tr to keep up tr to keep up uh i can play annie over i mean this is trash
what does this do hot garbage
i'm replacing the same unit yeah yeah i i was like why is it not

change i have a shentu just sitting here doing
nothing
haa all right sack four more and i'm probably still two lives even after i suck two
more i want a uh i want a i want like a combat augment i don't really want
i don't i i want a team combat augment like big grab bag no teaming up no like i mean magic wand is the
only thing i can take man i mean it's not terrible 18 ap like that's pretty
good my arc and then i go for another rod as well i don't know if my front line can
sustain an arc though i i mean it's fine there's no one to even hold this right now
anyway i play zyra for story so i should probably hold i can also hold this for
altruist i want to hold this in case i i find a zoe whatever
closer bro it's not even a loss it actually
isn't five you lost who the
cares hedge fun level 60 is that correct what do you think probably not that's
okay here comes
the
how do i play this i'm trying to
get how do i play this i have a like shen sitting
here like
no r zoe okay listen if i play zoe right like sure i i it's probably i heal more
than i lose but the thing is it's like bro my board has to be so bad that i'm pretty sure the the three that
you heal you might actually kill like one or two units so it's like i'm just rolling to lose gold basically my board
will be so bad like i i actually killed three here like is that even that bad no it's
not like i mean the unit is just so and then i have to play like teo as well to like minus
two you know
okay okay that's okay that's
okay i mean i like like rabbit on i mean i have to like honestly it
might actually be archangel anyway
no like i i just need to like i need to just make sure i have a good ap carry so i actually have some damage like i can
go rabon play around tear which is have shiv or i can go have a ashe
to light up like h like rabid on play around tear
is actually cuz i sh is kind of good like really good like tris honestly and then i i hate
archangel agreed also my i just put a rod on this by accident okay it's fine
whatever all right how many units am i killing here i think
zero that's fine who cares i mean you can't tell me i don't
win this game 50 charge cash out i'm still two liv loss no you can't tell me it's not over i'm 30 hp right now 32 next turn even i
get 10 oed i'm guaranteed first y2 is y2 it get him and no one cares about tattoo of
bombardment okay but sniper
sniper all right let me let me just make sure i
have whatever i know i'm going to sell on the right i'm probably selling these as well
but like i i know for sure i'm selling these all is my last loss ti shun rabit
on play on tear red buff on uh
irelia think verb ashe would got an extra cast off and i would probably should kill some like 17 hp two lives the
game's over
relax oh honestly what if someone just hit two star four cost no they
won't 50 charge cash out two
lives
come closer the power of a
dragon
ren come closer i'm confused no not safe
while i'm free be my i'm coming for
you wouldn't wish my on anybody okay i mean i don't even need to roll
anymore i have three exalted in yeah it's three warden but who the
cares
teer glove have a glove to play around
honestly i should just roll the cut no travel
awaits
fes life fes miss
an3 miss3 again i'm
like this is the thing like what is this nothing
sraa what the do saka do nothing another amy
y okay i this board actually looks fine though i was getting kind of scared
though cuz i almost lost that fight but i'm pretty sure i can just sit sit on this board and just go straight to nine or 10 oh senon oh
sorry with me you got
it i need to deny other people their three
stars it's not any 3 cuz i win this game if i just two start my for cost even if i'm close like who the
cares i can't lose this it's
impossible i have zyra which is half sage i me never playing ribbon i justly i can't play riven of
the past i have two annie tubes my
board's not even good like i don't even have wukong on my board which is heavenly i have a stupid ass set
on my board that does absolutely nothing but set two is okay i
guess i play nautilus lilia as well never playing
that a
tail i mean i can also just roll for annie
and then like i only need two like i'm guaranteed to hit i mean yeah
probably i just got a full
tg like there zero and's gone
i don't know what they're
pinging heart is empty without empathy we are made by our choices i a
nautilus 2 on bench my journey is only beginning all right wouldn't my on i mean okay i should
probably just roll on neutrals though or like roll on whatever it's called cuz no matter what like i don't
want to hatch this all right like is here is here no i is

okay legends are told in word and deed
we can be okay well i just threw the
game yay you know i was guaranteed to win this g if i just went 10 and uh yeah i

garbage who is holding who is who the is holding what's it
called

all right let me see what people are playing real
quick okay it's looking like a forc for me oh
kill this before healing orbs all right one more before healing orbs oh this is like the best oh
no i mean it's fine oh yo what the is this i mean there's there's a lux
with rod though ah nah like nah like a shiv like bro like i already won the game a
three cost tear and i need another tear like bro i take the lux with rod like i need a like i need rod but i only need one but i need two tiers who the am
i even talking to i actually need to pee really

bad vol bear
in darkness we find
ourselves travel await what is this just ghostly but i get bruiser for two giga
units i mean that's pretty good what's the ink shadow
bombardment there's a uh a nico wait which which four do i even play do i play nico
it's like a mumu oawi
lux or not sorry alla lux do you play nico or
no bro what is this i killed nothing i
think like actually i mean when don't i want to play a better arc
like lux alawi what ahri syndra syndra plus one this eventually
y this kin actually
useless uh i mean i can also just put items on tom
kench i it's actually a decent amount of hp
though
okay allawi amumu lux lux lux lux amumu amumu allawi seven
arcanist on eight or six four or on eight or
seven yeah then c want to find
l i don't really want to roll that much though because i'm sitting like this rex side reide is not even that that bad
like rex side 2 rex side 2 is actually a decent amount of
hp it's i mean it's not that bad it's all right go pee i'm too lazy such then
cleared it oh oh
no it is my mouth which all travels in 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 i mean i kind of want porcelain odds
and i want arcanus odds but i already have this already gives porcelain odds how can i get bro i have to get
weaker for a turn
really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 exalted
counts all right that's perfect uh i mean jg is fine it's
fine never a moment i don't want to level to six on this turn cuz i'm playing a six three two
roll all right please please please actually i don't even know what i want porcelain wait do i even want like what
do i even want
porcelain oh no i already have all the amumu stuff cuz i have warden in and i have porcel in i have three tailored
here out of nine traits cuz i exalted in dclaw
ldp ter dclaw is kind of good i mean ldp is also good i they're both
good like they're both good i already have gargoyle uh like ldp is a guaranteed
forc and gg's i hit arus it's good enough
whatever spirit
call uh like jg and then i i go for a
tear on carousel
gg
okay go but now like instead of capping around four porcel i'm probably just capping around six arcanist arcanist a
mumu s on six all right how many how many luxes are
gone oh moo moo probably not
enough i'm what's your name oh so how many how many oh lux two i want to see
everything okay bet i'm done rolling for sure i want to see everything
amoo let's find
gargoyles shiv jg shun i need a shojin or i can't play the
game all right i'm
back
we need zero op so the four fun starts i mean i actually haven't played this comp yet it's kind of fun
though all right oh oh wait wait wait wait
wait no no no just take the other one man no no oh okay i don't wait oh i mean that
is good that's really good i mean shun five autos to cast like i'm
back weaker i mean yeah but like how do you know i'm not going to find another momu in my shop next round watch this
aumu
please are i mean there's no way i'm rolling with with this board my board's actually
kind of decent all right you got
it all right can i just commit the tear
here it i mean you can't miss man i mean i can miss how do i know it's
not like i mean i can
miss is it do i scam a cast oh i do scam a cast it you can't miss a cast
kale three
can i get shojin
please what the bro if i just a stupid ass amumu
just i will not hold
back f hts you today power 40 all right
bet it's looking
good i ever even playing nico i mean i'm probably going to cap around six archinist on on seven i don't even want
to like i after i find one more lu i'm pretty sure i'm like stable with six arcanist on seven and i just don't play dt i don't play double mumu double lux
is fine six archinist i'll probably roll into one more lux cuz i want double lux too and then i'll just delay seven i
also want a mumu three but i should probably scout i don't know how many moves are gone no one's holding a mumu relax also i'm on long rock side wrong
luck side oh
man this teo just killed my killed my lux oh wait no i
didn't
man a m is so
cool
a
here the thing about light is it never really died well that's not good for
me a spat that's definitely not good i mean i can go fated plus one can i pair ahri and syndra
really i mean that's definitely not good for me i mean i can go adaptive but it's it's
not better
than also let me roll into one more lu okay this is my choice okay i mean i can
go like jg i mean adaptive jg on the second lux and then move the items when i hit me i have to i mean do i have to
go jg on second lux like i can go fated like fated amumu and it i give it
i heal 3% oh oh porcelain spat oh wait but then
the thing is oh i mean that's also not that good i mean know it's good but i already
have i already have arcanist spat so if i have arcanist spat i'll find another person in
spat
we have another arcanist spat so why my arcanist the aumu
then imagine it's not magic trash what is
that okay i'm one off lux i might as well just send it for
lux another syn all right i will not back
another zoe ahri okay lux three this is my
choice okay i just realized this argonus bat doesn't even do anything cuz i can't even dt aumu regardless i
just cuz if you play aumu oh that is not good i mean it gave me a lux it's fine
like it doesn't even work on dtm mumu anyway like it doesn't even work man please oh
my are you having fun over there you want to do
l also have like true wh i mean it gave me a lux like that's pretty good i
guess like i can play a fated unit i guess but i mean either way i can't play dt aumu until later so that's not good i
mean honestly it i'll just roll for a fated okay actually that's not even true because like it doesn't even do anything like i'm fading what like these
two pieces of that don't even do anything oh my god i mean it's
okay like it's fine okay i don't want to want to roll to like i don't want to break i should have some more money it's
fine time was never
never mind that's warden and now not that's niik 2 like nik 2 is niko2
fated okay i mean it's fine what is this or amumu
allawi this is the
worst okay i need a move three and then i level for four porcelain and that's the board so like oh
lord i can archinist like porcelain spat
archinist it's okay i'll figure something
out four clost champions
uh i need anti-heal as
well i don't think i'm hitting porcelain laoi the bow's gone that's fine
rod and there's an ashe there's a syndra 2 syndra 2 syndra
2 i want porcelain i'm i'm probably going to go porcelain
syndra all one off of a
moo i mean there's no way thresh is worse i herald the greatest blessing yeah with
cra too yeah there's no
way yeah okay and that is good fated sucks umbral okay rod glove
syndra two rod glove spat bow forel in here
amumu amumu
ashe like i'm about to
spike it missed the kindred just smurfed on me
it my cinder did more damage it's fine it's fine why am i even holding this like am
i really playing eight arist ever my level 9 can eight arist or no it's not that good anyway espe with arist on this
i mean i mean okay no it's pretty good like if i'm level n9 i definitely want to play six archinist but like theux is
kind of nice does ni come
back so oh you want same side cuz you want to kill this so you can start going on
side whatever if it doesn't come back who cares i'm not level 9 anytime
soon it only hits uh it only sts the uh the what's it called the first two
hits so you need to like like kill aide you want to just kill a side
it's not like it's going to stun the opposite you know i this is looking pretty good i'm
one off of a
mumu never
really ad arus probably isn't better than double like like like double like this
this but it definitely is better like it's not it's like like like dropping both of the twin is probably not that good but if i think if you go nine it's
it's worth it's an extra how much ap a lot it's 40 45 relative that's not that
much i mean it's a lot but it's not that much it's okay i'm not for a fun though
porcelain actually i can i can go eight
porcelain with without porcelain onu as well oh there's a p plus one as well it never
really it's just infinite gold legends are told in word
and i go for porcelain b me i don't really want to roll a single
time spat
bow i can remover this item
eventually glove cloak glove bow glove rod like hodge is fine i guess oh wait
was there a chain i just realized i don't have a third amumu item the wait was there a chain
help no oh okay i mean i can i can just move the adaptive off of this onto aumu
if i can get like a shun or something honestly it's probably already
better to just swap actually it's fine
i'm losing econ the hold zoe bro zoe comes back off not losing 30 40 then 50 it's always not worth six
gold cost to roll by one for the next six rounds w but i just
rolled
what or three three sorry three okay i mean it's fine like i let let me just
get back to 50 and then i'll just roll for an ashe sell the stupid ass thresh find nico and the thing level to nine i
just don't need dd honestly is leveling to nine even
better than like are like leveling to nine is is eight archinist oh oh wait i can just
play i can play the dude or uh list plus
one and that's four porcelain for free l over thresh you're today plus
one oh man it's looking like a
forc like i can argan a set as well all get free fated and warden and i just
don't dt amumu 45 ap whole board i kind of want to but then i i can remover the gargoyle off of the amumu if i'm eight
arcanist and then c around like giga amumu ashe reveal our
way oh no eight archinist doesn't matter right cuz it's what's it called
okay also should i try to okay i have not swwa a single time like surely i swa once oh help okay yeah surely like
i swa one time anyways like it doesn't matter cuz it's it's all it's not it doesn't double it's not like archinist
is is 250 it's only uh it's 125 regardless you know but the thing is
like i like this adaptive like rather go on a mumu but then i need a remover for it so it's not actually
good also this guy upet yeah so when the am i killing the
cindro then yeah i only have one remover
c oh
bye-bye no i only have one i can't double
remove i just realized i don't even i don't even think i have antiheal i
don't i me there's a
set okay great the anti- hill is gone yay
sage like if i if i get to the thing i i want to
get okay i'm pretty sure even if i have sh is better than this crown guard actually it's a lot of hp never
mind no it probably is there's no way i don't find a zoe or a nico like liss
over this and then nico or zoe over
this caes one oh no but i want to go nine like it's not worth it it's not worth it like i'm i'm going nine i'm
going nine like i have to roll for list anyway like what i already found ashe i was going to
roll for ashe
i hope the game gives me another remover
away i go three of them aumu three of them perfect lux but honestly i'll probably just keep
the lux items on here it's fine i'm on wrong side that going to be
good
some call me e make sure i don't miss these what is it eco
zoe

okay side's good really good what do you want to do
later honestly i don't like like whatever i don't need mana it attacks so fast with porcelain bye-bye
bye-bye stick to the plan you have a plan
this over this i i can't even play dte cuz i have
to play oh this is not good cuz i can't even play the wait what
the is the point of okay i just don't have to play ar these two spats are pissing me off
what i get something i hope a another spat
great i honestly do i even need a roll i'm what's your
name onbody what's your
name like no mumu like i can just play n already i mean i can play list over this and i have an extra unit there oh a red
buff that's pretty good like it's really
good okay honestly okay it's fine it's fine i was going to i was going to just remove her
and then and then oh no it's fine it's
fine i mean if i can make it to 10 i don't have to i can play a
mumu sarah's actually so lucky i'm fighting her
clone not hold back i'm kind just go for a list actually this way is not even
bad like eight arcanist way the list never
rest i have i have i have an argan spat on bench i need a remover
this i mean i can go set for f set for fated all right you got it
i don't even know who i'm fading oh i should probably fated onn
vamp and honestly i'm just going nine like whatever
10 ar move it doesn't work cuz you have if you have arcanist on this amumu and
you have another amumu on your board it's not going to let you uh it doesn't it like amumu can't archinist twice even
if they're two amumu with arcanist on
both exist to be
broken like bow on carousel i'm back why i mean it's just like that i
don't know

all right bow and carousel i can six porcel in it for free
undeniable
oh what the my my guy got just one shot hello come back we got one
shot
oh there's a full porcelain spot works for me i don't even have to go to the boat
all right
bet never fl bls to
be make sure i find one ashe
yeah hey spirit reveal our

way okay eight arcanus six parcel this it over it's uh 30 oh wait it's 125% as
instead with 60% reduced damage what you can't play the
game i have a dead amumu item cuz arcanist is uh whole board now but it was it was spike on for sure
though i bet man all
good

well like i mean if i slam sunfire here can i actually win this fight probably i mean i'm not killing a single
unit now cuz of red oh whatever man i took branching like what am i even doing man i'm not locked in like all
right why did i take branching out all right like i'll try hard this game like this is just i'm sorry i like people are
here to
learn
like starting now it like like it's zero op and then just just
watch when when augments are being selected i'm not even going to bother
looking at chat just keep begging you're not you're talking to no one keep begging i don't give a bch bch i
okay yeah who the are you talking
too now you see him now you don't not
me all right it like you just go kindred ghosty roll i kind of want to try this comp no but the comp's actually
good though i think like it's actually
good my destination is clear no it's actually good i think if you hit
like fast enough i just saw someone have an affili the w and weave the fate guides w
spoil the
chase oh it's
time i i kind of need a tear though for it to actually good
selling interest i can also play du from this spot like b with
chain i kind of want to hold the kha'zix darius 2 is darius 2 we're selling you
then kha'zix i also kind want to hold the jax honestly the tra it's a
t i just sold my tristana stupid ass game bro
please i mean it's even like whatever man it's it's too much fun it i'm zero op anyway it
kobuko oh bet new day new friends save old
me i mean did i just win the game then probably
probably as you
wish i mean
probably all i kill one here i win the game i killed the sh just just wrap it
up okay it doesn't matter i still on the game who cares fate hunts you
today uh encounter giv h be

here glove or tear i mean the tear spikes me
like like glove is is is for max cap and i'm playing for masx cap i'm not a loser it's all
good yeah i'm just going to
s spirits are calling who kills who kills the most i mean it's not like i
can make econ i have to play a
unit also like i don't even know why i'm toggling this turn because no matter what i'm going to lose right yeah
probably you think i kill one here
wait 200 lp loses all of it is it even my fault man like it's actually good zero
lp farms ters off mickey mini donald daisy goofy and pluto man it's just boring these guys aren't even trying ano
shut the up who are you talking

okay honestly i just max cap another tg i just tg all my legendary units
probably not but i mean it's a three cost that's pretty good
yay okay but seriously how can this be his divine rolls board oh you know what probably happened
i think he might have thought that the rolls like bank and then he just lost all his rolls or
something like i might actually be what happened i mean i can't fortune toggle
if i keep tristana unless i don't fortune toggle
but like what if he sells nico like surely he doesn't sell
nico like i kind of want a zoe potential he sold the
nico i'm fighting him i think i won and i didn't forge in
toggle because i i want to hold the trist i can heal
five like i just like i don't get this like it makes no sense like how is this
real like how can a player like this
exist oh oh i can just sell oh i'm still going to win like i'm going to play three units like my units are better than his
like i have to play three units like
please like he is mal fight mal fight kha'zix and i have to play i have to play thre like cu other match up like
come on man it's okay i mean it's fine like i find zoe like i'll just push like three
times like no i'll end this guy like it doesn't even matter it's fine

high number i'm just going to three five and and roll for annie or zoe so i can start
healing but honestly i might be a level roll
regardless any any uh team supports is good honestly big grabag is not terrible

five more rounds i mean it's fine like i i'm probably going to win a
round like like i'm going to win around later like i'll probably win around on stage four randomly like it's
fine

boring c sh two level seven uh five fated i'm not beating
anyone uh sh even better than i mean ap for
who for zoe plus

arrive oh no no no no no no no no bro please i'm fortune
man what the please i'm just giving these guys a chance to catch up
like
it's two components and two gold it's fine it's not a big deal oh honestly i'm
looking at these nico items i'm actually kind of scared that i'm going to win i i'm not beating this guy this guy's kind of strong f to plus the d two
c2 shentu uh y to i'm kind of scared though
maybe i
just oh you don't want to uh you don't
want to dance because like i don't want to give them an opportunity to catch up like i'm playing fortune cash out right so i'm going to be up resources but if
i'm up like bro if i if i just played the thing correctly i would have killed another whatever if if i like if if i'm
d like if i uh if i like the difference of five components to seven is not as big as 7 to n like yeah oh oh y all
right bad this gu but anyways it only clouds the future because it's it's like relative
right yeah but also like i would like i'm down to like lose like a few more like i need
to start like i don't even care if i win anymore cuz i'm trying like i i win the game regardless as long as i don't die i
win this game regardless i just need to not die
but i like i'm i'd rather lose this next one and then win like one of the later ones but if that doesn't work out like
let's move i've like sure that build one one damage
item or or tank
item

pretty good like sal gallo is worthless okay i can
play actually i might i can get three exalted in really easily like one irelia set two set

fortune like i don't need to roll too
easy
come closer to
be okay honestly doesn't the zia actually kind of do some
work or no
no really it has trick shot though like it actually has trick shot like
altruist no no it's good it's good like relax i'm not bening anything anymore
okay it's fine it's fine like i'd rather have some damage like i like i have no
damage it's not it's not four it's only three altruist right cuz i don't have a riven like i don't know how much 8 it
has but has a lot but a lot a lot that was beautiful baby okay this
damage is just straight up pathetic but i mean it has a shun on it man like come on let's move all right one two 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13
traits oh there's l
whisper nah i need some i need some single
target or i'm eight what am i leveling for
irelia no i mean then why am i playing le
in art is empty without empathy
thresh is three traits oh oh oh oh it is okay it's okay honestly like like
this unit like a sh morello and then i can to that like i need to i need to make a new
sraa this is
necessary like and then i i showed him
this all looking pretty solid to me beautiful baby this reminds me of our
first bro is not even that bad man like it's three it's three items like like i need some like it's fine it's fine but
also i don't really want to roll coming for you actually i mean i might as well roll
cuz i need to find the five cost to buffer anyway and then like while i find this five cost two off like three
altruist like three alist is better than one trait like fortune okay or two that okay
irelia is like 17 traits how do i play
irelia i mean i can't oh wait oh actually i'm done rolling actually i level for
tr i know four alas is good but i have i have uh what's it
called i have uh guinsoo shan last whisper bro relax buddy like come on like i'd
rather just deal more damage like come on and you thought it was just a harmless
bree i can i can draw i probably won't drop play actually it's kind of good like like this free mythic heavenly
and like it's fine wukong's also two synergies irelia has two synergies i mean if i go nine or 10 i get an extra like
17 traits okay i hatch a in one turn make this piece of shun on this not
even sure why i'm forting also why am i
not does this gain hp if i front line it 2.1 i don't even know oh
wait i just remake rakan gia story weaver du and exalted
this reminds me of our first but i kind of want to what is this invoker dord heavenly
altruist oh honestly okay i'm going to say heavenly altr it's not even
heavenly it's just it's just three altruists no diff irelia 2 is irelia to it

win anyway all right i'm just going to start
losing then all right please fortune plus one fortune plus one please it branching
out just play for fun i it's already too late i already
sold that trash okay i mean i can take blister st n too bad whatever
gg's i'm going to lose

f hunts you today i just want sl i not my bo is even
bad my f is so bad though i don't even think my k can scale also is this
visual or is it like actually
bg okay it looks visual it looks like it's actually attacking past it is it as
bug i mean it looks like it's attacking back okay i mean this unit
sucks i'm willing to roll for the thing but let me uh i'll level oh that's bad for me
what i me i'm just trying to scale this is looking good to me okay but i need a
civer where the is the civer i i can go seven story right

now i don't even want to s gg
that okay i try i try to cash out a 30 and i can 10 story if i can make it to 10 i'm not to just level and roll for an
annie or a
tristana i could go chain maybe i get a spat i mean not really for cost is for cost okay i
need wait i can hit story plus one on four too i just realized cuz branching out doesn't count and watering trainer
doesn't count so i can still hit it on
augment oh one oh but i kind of wanted to get to 30 though violence to end
violence honestly i think i'll just take the
20 cuz the only way it rolls it goes to 30 is if i roll one
again and i kind of want to start winning
yeah oh oh wait oh you can get a spat on
20 oh you're
right oh i only need level 9 as
well please all right what are the odds of
spat
20% all right
please
it roll the one i had a 40% chance for home
t i go where the trouble
is i'm coming for
you
i'm never playing fortune again out of here what's your also i need to get this to
i lost anyway okay it's fine you know i'm pretty sure i would have won if i just had story weaver slammed but it's
like i'm not trying to put it on on that garbage like i'm going straight to nine i'm not rolling a single
time we are made by our choices what is this just
sage i'm not trying to play dryad i'm not trying to play ghostly plus the thing
i'm i'm eight story i'm not sure why i'm playing
civer i am awakened let's
move 10 story says bro i it has it's an instant win it has like a 97% win rate
it's the most broken train in the
game wait what

i this shred is
fake okay i'm going straight to nine so g for a second
this story weaver dude sucks who is letting this guy cast again
seriously how are you letting this yon cast again i don't know i don't know i
don't know oh oh what's this it cast it again at one hp
like w this game is over it is
over oh my okay i can i can i don't even need level
10 cuz i have a story weaver emblem on the thing oh
my
okay well i need to i need to sell air
eventually cuz i i need i need someone to hold the story weaver on nine but uh yeah this this game's over i just need
one irelia and in two turns i'm leveling to n and sending it to zero and honestly my
bo's not even that bad i have g 2
now it's all good look what you made me do no irelia pre i you have to hit
something irelia to
opponents legends are told in word and
deed it's all good all right bye-bye
bye-bye

damn i'm a beast honestly this this hit the whole
board immediately so i don't need chip
then all right g db
redemption all this game is fing over man i'm 10 story on
43 i will not hold
back dead unit dead unit my entire board is
trash i just want more like like like upfront damage cuz uh yeah i mean i it just goes
infinite honestly i'm kind of down like if i get more sage i just front line my
kale this is
necessary
i have 20% omn
vamp


oh i can't i can't play valerin it uh it won't let me it let you the q is or like it ts out when you get in
game

s can get exalted in
look what you made me do solo front kale or
b you know a guy in my chat said 10 story weaver
sucks
like like

what i i don't want people to hit three star for cost but honestly i'm pretty sure i beat that so you know what i'll
let them hit it i don't even know why i'm
going yeah i am that
good legends are told in word and deed i go where that's not actually good
it doesn't do
anything
i am awakened
backline the shs but i might actually lose like if i lose my streak the
chances of me going for a three star five ca is zero so isn't that isn't that more
exciting we can be
here
maybe i can three star five cost this

game
okay honestly i'm looking at this i'm not to just i'm not to just solo front line it okay but honestly if it gets
targeted by everything and then gets cced isn't it just
dead like everything's attacking get cc once it's dead like it's dead for sure
no my journey's only beginning whatever man like
sure all i'll give it a redemption how about
that list kills her oh h nah no list
nah and yeah nah oh wait wait he has a list wait wait
wait
okay but if they have list is actually kind of scary oh she'll kill it before it cast
really oh
okay
i don't even know what i
want what' i get oh qss that's not bad wouldn't wish
my f on anybody i level
rong

wait he just moved list to the left and and followed me a man just try stop oh
it's dead okay i can sol the front line it for sure what is this
it's 6k
hp sell all your you can't how do i how can i get
10 what
you might as well just give the the kale sage here i'll here i'll just do
this
too easy i am
awakened and i just guaranteed 90 everyone end the game
faster
i never
rest i think i think kale's about to level up actually cuz it skills off of
stage tell a different
tale legends are told in word and
deed the power of a dragon

this is
necessary
honestly te
it wait what okay it it probably didn't even
ascend i never rest show me
the okay i need to hold the five cost though
take back guard is empty without i'm not
hitting

pouring i think he went for list three but then i was holding list on my
roll down
oh

i call the chaos it i mean it's my only takeable option
what i get here comes
the 26 gold okay and then you know i'll just stop it there so it is 1 two 4 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 11 - 1 - 1 9 + 20 29 gold tear one giving 29
extra gold
assuming you're not getting any gold anymore starting 41 and you
didn't and gold calculated
calculated with bronze player that doesn't six on 31 with or 7
on 35 but calculated gold with non
bronze so if you you're you're you're going into 41 with 30 extra gold
assuming it doesn't like and it still gives you two gold to turn and then
and you're able to level to six on 31 and level to seven on 35 hello this story is not yet finished
like does that make sense why i'm bitching like the casual players don't
even understand like why why it's so like like cringe like i it's so like who who have riot designed
this
no one is promised tomorrow like the fact that this this went to live it's actually just i alone
de oh wait oh i won game but i'm just saying it's unbelievable like it actually is
unbelievable like the stats and pve were for sure insane cuz it got buffed like 10 pve cycles away uh
go so i don't i don't know
the tear rod oh this opener is guaranteed to like sharing his caring okay i'm not
even mad like sharing his caring in scuttle puddle is not that broken because if you like okay so like how the
math works right oh this is the wrong like so like the thing is like on normal
galaxies right like you can barely like you can't get to 50 fast but in scuttle puddle you get to 50 fast so the gold
diff is is not it's not infinite gold it's only like it's only like 20 gold like 20 something gold like that's not
nearly as bad as 30 gold and the ability actually you know what if you okay sorry hold on let me let me give me one
sec uh i kind of want the
shield i don't really want to
itemize okay sorry um wait what was i
saying better oh no it's uh i would hold ar if it's ar pair but otherwise but i still want to link these because uh the
ap is better on this
noom watch

this bro my opener is actually good though
like i have units that that do stuff i get a two star i get a three
cost and a two star two cost that's it whatever what is it kobuko
qiyana it's fine whatever at least there's no one with a with a three cost
like like it it's it becomes stupid when someone has like a three cost you can recon pop into a four cost or a four
cost that recon pops into a five
cost making
20 i feel like it feels like worse this set but that's because like a lot of the
legendaries a man let see a lot of the legendaries are
are like like super scalers like if you hit set early you just win the game like whe you instantly win the game like this
is dryad as well set scales list scales like that's already half of
them cuz this is one like like you have a 50% chance to win the
game
what
level five that's
great is cate into rec yeah it is this shit's beyond broken
actually it's not it's not that broken because the thing is then you kind of grief your starter kit then you lose your 41 spike but like i mean it's it's
still broken like you have a five
cost oh wait if i get this i win the
game and i won the game this thing's
over
does reton scale what is go oh it's uh it's

scuttle and i can make econ
and i have a combat augment let me see what people are playing find
vintage but yeah i mean this is the last thing i'll say on sharing scaring the reason that aug just puts me in a bad
mood is like so like if you look at this game right like scuttle puddle like i'm making 30 so that's why like if someone
has sharing caring i'm not going to complain too hard but usually you're at 10 gold here but the sharing is carrying
players are guaranteed 20 thank you thank you thank you thank
you f oh oh
sorry uh 300 health 30 ap
180 i mean i'd rather buff my sch
though i me i'll win

unable this guy is piss spirits are
calling what i'm playing fast sign i have a really good opener if you have uh ap items with um kindred uh yu r
kindred and you can like let's say you can go into 41 with like 50 gold or it's econ galaxy or 41 with 80 hp or it's
econ galaxy you can just sack stage 4 level to 9 on 51 it's a win
out
yeah alon
kobuko qiyana i can play
thresh thresh
kobuko chain chain b day everyone gets golden or by the way
it's not just me
i'm zoe what's your
name a full red buff all allow

it okay i just fated plus one bro fated plus one is so boring though oh man i
mean there's nothing wrong with winning the game for
free holy is that strong
syndra that's okay that's okay
than oh l game specialist and i'm just going straight to nine it i mean
i'm down it's actually good i am living change uh i have yuu ahri spat
chain pumping up shiv rabbit on red 32 to level brer
duelist mythic coming if i get two turns of
exalted they call me
or not mythic exalted it would have to be
thresh kobuko plus one
shter
ready to eight free rolls this round i mean then i'm leveling for sure the
i h great roll on seven
odds yes oh

i will not hold back who the am i missing i fated
with attack speed honestly i have more
rolls i need to hold this how do i hold this my bench is just i've got
people another ahri i could have had ahri too ni i kind of want ni as well
though i kind of want g as well oh i kind of want that as
well like okay i kind of want like i want that as well but i also want to make 30 all right these units
a i'm out rolls okay wa i lost i this gu level the
seven now he has just seven barred okay it's fine it's not a big deal
sping
is that for me please oh
okay i need replacement
kind
spat
rod so these two
though haawi is actually a good unit cos is
reapered kayn over
clx
rush side over brush oh no it's uh oh don't don't fade don't link the fated
spat bro that like let let me tell you what the fated spat does it's uh it's 3%
of your max health over 3 seconds bro what are you hungry oh i could
eat it's uh it's if you don't have a secondary tank ah whatever just like just it's
fine you you you got
it i feel like cindra actually does damage though but it's it's more like not really i mean lot is
l i don't really want to sell this but i'm definitely not selling that it's
uh
yeah like it it'll be
obvious proba oh that's fine you always link front line not
primary tank with primary oh no i mean it depends cuz uh the fated pair also gains ah like this fade okay honestly
someone needs to make a youtube video and then i can just link it cuz i'm too lazy i i talk about it every time okay so how it works the fated pair
gains also 20% health so it's kind of worth it like it's especially worth it if you have set but also like different fights have different win
cons yeah all right bet did my job like
for example they have way right like let's say they have way and they have no single target and you have set that
gives omn vamp you could go like set with thresh but if you have like but if you have like three item syndra then you
go set with syndra as the max cap cuz like no like they're not going to onot your your syndra like the white can't one shot your syndra from 2.5k hp and then you just
uh and then you just omn bam go infinite but like if but
sometimes yeah should guinsoo oh guinsoo sucks don't trash make me stronger what
the seven i was just straight
trash lose rad i i can't lose
reaper uh i mean my front line still sucks cuz i have no items but like let's say i had orange too then like you
wouldn't you would pair i mean i can gain a lot of ap my feel doesn't look that bad
it's pretty bad i can give whole boards 900 health and 60 armor 60 mr it's kind
of good belt belt
change i'm just loading with 60 armor 60
mr man this fad trait is too
exciting it's just too exciting
yay

i can go stationary but i can also go new recruit i'm i'm making it to fast n i
want to see everything like i'm like i mean yeah i
can new recruit guarantee everything and also uh there's no way i'm not playing another legendary set two it's going to
be set two syndra 2 set two syndra 2 list
two uder
2 i need to remake ai though it's not even a loss
wait that wi this high key i i think i
won wow i'm down
aisen what the
oh my
god let me see how many cer players if there's zero cer players like it i just don't go nine i have i have late game specialist
though oh honestly wait this is fine i i can just l wait i can just level next turn wait this is actually good for me
oh thanks riot let me let me oh i need to
frontline my my affili i'm level 9ine
rolling some
gold has aist holy theying hed fun he's level
940 oh
no and seven fated is so
cool
bye-bye all titans is true b 45% om vamp and i just pair it with like some other and i call
it i could just go thresh as well on vamp with thresh actually this guy's
barred three the other dude three wait art is empty without
empathy how much is the roll it's still two thingss i herald the greatest
blessing your journey oh nice die in
mine okay i mean i might as well make one
turn and then next turn i'm just going to send it cuz it's one goal to
roll oh wait wait
wait i mean bar 3 tk3 who
cares i honestly i'm not i don't even think i'm playing way unless i'm fitting i mean i could also just fade it
way and go for the one shot like ap plus
something h all right i'm going straight to zero gg's i will not hold back i mean
why the am i still play this garbage heart is empty without empathy
spirits are calling one goal to roll you can't miss i want to see
everything that
unit i mean i i need i need to replace this anyway your but then i i also
honest holding this one hold to roll
this oh man i actually miss syndra
3 i need to do i just lock this okay honestly the way is a grief like i don't
even know i'm playing white but i might as well just paint paint
one i never
rest like i could fated
this nah like i i'm just going to go max cap
it i will not hold back like i just paint the syndra and i
just go for syndra 3 away a man this
is i'm down such
power i didn't even have syn tos to be seen oh wait i have six synr already wait what the
stick to the plan we have a plan i wait what i'm guaranteed cer 3 what
the


at last our ascension is
at oh you link the f the the fated the fated units gain the the bonus of the
pair so it's omn vamp and damage or guaranteed relax buddy relax
buddy we are made by our i'm down to roll cuz then i know if i want to go
for the other dude cuz i also want set
asap hunt you a man okay i'm just going to go for cra
then a man but like said actually gains
more i this early when my set sucks i mean my list does not
suck i mean maybe maybe there's a sy
next
shop that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first but you see how
he's playing way and it can't one shot the syndra and then if you pair the omn vamp like how like how is it going to kill
this okay well actually my my set's dead but that's cuz it's a set one like if it were set two it just goes
infinite
okay such power
honestly this is even worth my econ this you forgot to

bow oh it's a yeah yeah it's uh sorry the fated bonus is 15% on the vamp 7
fated is 300% so 40 % this one f is 10% more

damage but i i think like the biggest reason fated is like so good is because in the meta like if they can't onot your
carry like the fast kn board can actually struggle against
like gs it can actually struggle against like yon and stuff because you can't kill
itana is
exalted what set two no just finish the finish the uh
the cer item i have i have 16 dead units on my
board is there better exalted aumu
alune i mean i have a dead way on my board and a dead qiyana heaven bless but
i'm going straight to
10 i can play a
moomo

away
well you have to play forward for arist it's a c 3 i have iie so you want you want flat
ap bro i'm not farmed a single component you know let me frine the problem is his front line's dying too
fast
level 950 too

guide sock one per vable i me i can't even play it
until it's fine i'll just play like i'll just honestly this way is useless like there's no way i don't hit set two like like what like i'll just
and i can just send an ex turn and then i just start dumpstering soon unless he has like sets or
something which he probably doesn't yeah they don't wait he's going for or 3
hello what am i looking for

closest to find
some like for warden 2 z two no i mean zero off okay
this is lord it's kind of unfortunate the oh wait oh wait i can play alune oh
wait wa alune please i definitely roll past i forgot about
alune
are you having fun over there what do you want to do
later expent
away bro why is this guy still in the
game triad to to make traits look nice wait there's another fated plus one
oh b i can drop the stupid ass
kindred my channel the spirit i feel closer oh wait no no no but now my now
my traits don't look nice like oh no like whatever i you know i you know what
if you were to if you were to pick between him having to play another two
rounds but my my border would have been
insane

soju is like that one mc in isekai who hide his power oh wait give me one second sl user
em game 2 wait what it says he's
banned he said this last much as you're so
bad like like if if your opener is not good
and you're slamming wide that's the sign of a player like if you slam wide with a bad opener it just means you're
terrible with the game because then you're just going to get lost later and it's not because you got lost it's because the game is not
balanced like and you should have played around like sacking your early game because you can't like there's no there's no like intermediate board does
that make sense like what is sing gu is like being like willing to make suboptimal
items it it's it's like it's not like you actually got lost it's
just it's just how the game is like i mean i mean like that like that's what makes the game so fun like every game is
different y
y fun no but honestly it is like it it
actually like i don't like people don't think about it but it's like saving hp early isn't always correct if like like
let's say you go win lose win lose and then you have suboptimal items what the is your game
plan like you're you're just guaranteed dead
last
epoch
like here like i can just hard force duelist i'm like not
contested oh it's not even a hard force that is not always a
release d volar might be
true or g coming sorry and then like all you need is i
mean you want last wher titans but like you need a last whisper and like i mean honestly it's fine like you you want titans titans
titans bett on vol bear and you win the game but uh gum blade is the same thing
so it's fine i already have like four dualists early game so it's like too good and now i'm just committed to
duelist yay rare duelist game i mean duelist are good like they're actually good it's
just uh uh it's kind of augment based like
keepers is really good um the dueling dueling i don't even know what it's
called
yes oh i was going to say dueling gunners it's it's
like what what even is it called extend the duel extend the duelist yeah
that as you wish otherwise it's not so good oh gargantuan is also good let me
here stats i mean if you if you don't know six duelist and volley three tristana
3 augment what even are the best ones gargantuan
keepers all the hp ones yeah i mean actually is du plus one even
good maybe it's not duelist plus one that's not that
good but that's like it it it helps my mid game early mid game like gives me four four d right now i can see it
though because the thing is the only thing it does is gives you three stage later so it's 8% omn vamp but if you
pair that with
yeah in darkness we find
ourselves our next augment is coming up i really hope i hit
dueling uh extended duel based on tactics side tools your
flexibility is s+ but your econ is b might be the reason you having a bit
issues wait really wa i feel like my econ's pretty
good wait how do they even okay honestly you know what i'm glad that econ is b he
i think the less gold you have the more real player it is because earlier today i was watching milk play
and then i was like and i was like oh like he was just like oh like what even is the fast nine board and then i was like what do you mean like i mean that
you can only play that from like giga high giga opener and he said he's in build your board
low which means that you can play anything you want because the players are so bad their mid games are
so that you'll make it to 9 every game i mean he i mean he's right like if
if everyone's mid game is you're level 9 every time wait didn't the stat say twin terror was
broken wait why
though it averages oh it it's 130 games but it averages and you just play four
duelist bro i'm not going trainer when i when i bro
what i alone decide my fate you forgot
wow damn i might be the goat
seriously zo the whis of
tft uh yeah maybe the jing of tft it's all good the
zen
the frein the
fern just to know man the tactical of
tft hold on hold on give me a second i need to show you that guy i don't even follow lcs at
all occasionally like every month or so i'll just check on how immorals is doing and then i just send him a discord dm
i'm surprised he hasn't blocked me hold on let me he he
tweets immortal is coming to diff everyone in 2024 and then i checked yeah
they're dead last respond lmfao question
mark dead last again it's all
good i don't even watch the tactical of
tft honestly and what's it called extended dual i wouldn't be surprised if b vol bear is just titans titans
titans like if i have six duelist volley three extended duelist extended duel
three items titon
titans i it's really hard to build but like if you can get it
maybe is it what's bt 3.55 i mean it's not a sample size i'll probably just
build bt or gum blade gun blade is plus delta but i mean how is i going to kill the rod i don't
know that's a weird question that's why i lost my streak this
game alune not my fault they should have
bowed rod what the is
this okay is rabadons on on what's his name even
bad on on on tristana i mean i have to i mean no one's making a
10 games though i mean i have to make rabadons there's no way i'm not making rabadons all right you got it
man i'm going to dual cilia for the entirety of mid game i can't slam ship
though i mean like it's not even that bad like how much damage bonus is it uh 20% bonus damage i me that's
pretty good i'll allow
it also i can rabit on diana right du rabit
on diana oh o wait that sounds kind of
good it darus three i it's darus 3 i'm down to another
bow i didn't get a chain can i
leave a bob in fact i didn't get a bow either a b
i'm e i mean i can't slam red buff i need the
thingy uh
titans whatever just kill the uh kill the tear real quick also i forgot to level
oops fast the moment i get an umbr i'm going to move duelist to here okay honestly i just thought like
what the am i
figh i could have leveled here
oops one level another
darus i for what it's ad
and hp there's two stair is
twoa
okay most of the time okay hold on darius yasuo
qiyana diana
w trana wein 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even
eight i mean it's not a real loss like it's
fine uh ginu is great overal fast night yeah but yeah there's no way i'm fast on like d always rs on seven like your
level 9 board even with a irelia 2 is is weaker than if you have volley 3 tr 3 like no volley 3 no tr three you can
just leave the game there's no
chain i mean it's fine another bow is good it's just another like i i got worried about the last titans later like
okay i didn't even get the bow what the what the okay one
gs is fine i guess
oh yeah also yeah rage b really is just bad on 68 ds you're right you're not
wrong uh i don't really want to hodge the dude is there another i need another umbral unit how
many umbral are there yon alon y rick also i find one vol bear honestly
i'm just going to roll on on eight cuz it's two turns of of super board i mean k too okay i don't want to roll anymore
also is it just gs time always it's not always gs
cuz okay it's not always gs but now that i have k 2 i can't
anymore i have a liia wait i can follow this i i like i'm like what is going on
i hello i don't have a single titans oh honestly like you can't even
lie like whatever it doesn't matter like look at my augments i already won the game oh no you you need titans like this
vol bear like your front line is the vol bear like just don't worry like i'm going to win out don't worry i'm scaling
necessary i mean i can just lose umbral 200 hp whole board lose
umbral i mean this is a 60 hp whole board i mean i get execute who the cares i also gain ad like i could have
just done this last turn oops that's okay mystic or
mythic honestly it's probably the part of the front line actually no it's
not trash unit never upgrading make
qiyana one two three i died instantly i'm fighting an
aos too it's fine it's fine you know usually du have like a pretty decent stage three
it's fine why the do you have decap
going a du xdd what do you do with two rods then thank you meod 1997 you know
what i'll gift you a sub if there were more people like you i could save my breath and not have to respond to idiots you right as all right gifted a sub
thank you the power of a
dragon travel awa this is
necessary bl
list plus one this is not my they should have
bow wait also wait what the even is my board it's there's no way it's three sage
right like there's no way it's it's heaven wait is it heavenly do i just play heavenly on on
this wait what the is my board on on plus one also should i be rolling here wait
titans i want hod on here eventually last whisper
db save rabadons
wait what the is my board titans titans hodge this doesn't
need
healing i'm pretty sure three sage is better
than is it it's not vertical
dord my board's actually good six toist k
to you forgot b deny me no longer light i should probably roll
until two stars this is
necessary you forgot wow sh some here comes the
bo okay hod titans hodge plus one bow
titon diana zyra is heavenly better
than i mean there's no way it's hp right my bir's actually pretty good now
but okay i'm starting to think i know why the dual stats are not that good but honestly dual stat 3 is actually
good but i need some items
items light
like oh wait i don't even oh i don't oh i
don't have sage oh i thought i had sage it oh 10% oh wait what the wait
i'll take 12% omniv vamp oh i'm an idiot
sorry i this darius 3 is not that worth
sorry i thought i had sayen it's uh it's too expensive no one
cares like it's not like this unit does
anything omn vamp is omn vamp my board is a pile of
okay i mean that's not
good hi i'm current sting sitting on three b bears four tranas oh that
is bad that is very
bad honestly this call me the the i prove them right
also like my item distribution is so
bad the chain's gone wait there's a wait is that for
me do i just take the vol bear i don't think i don't think i'll make it if i take the vola bear i'll make i'm making
it i'm making it i'm making
it so dog biscuit thank you for the prime know your enemy crush test dummies
you have my bow it's not that tons of stats know your enemy i mean it's not that capricious forge crushes dummies i
mean front line is front line it's actually kind of good like i can't like
risk i mean i could risk rolling this to wukong also irelia is good too so it's kind of good the spirits i feel closest to i'
rather roll threes than then what is this darious
trash okay i don't really want to set the bow in
here like one irelia is huge it's fine i'm
scaling i'm i'm about to spike in in how many turns in two turns cuz i'm about to
have three items on everyone i'm sitting here two item two item two this actual whis
but when i get when i get three items on everyone my board is actually strong but my board right now is so
bad extend is so good though 10% on them
you don't have to put a healing on break
me here comes the oh what the and anelia all right out of here peace
it's not actually good i have zero items for irelia but this irelia unit just one bullet to everyone also wukong is
actually okay that's not true is pretty
good so like you can't level until wait later like i'll find one i'll find one my bench is full like you you'll get these
eventually and if you don't like bro i'm suck on level seven for the next
year holy this di it's
okay how many more rounds of this is there three another
a a
maybe i should to roll for i harald the greatest
blessing i harald the greatest
blessing now you see him now you don't okay it's
fine like whatever miss tiana 3 not oh
okay this is necessary my destination is clear i bu
the greatest blessing your journey or die in my nice
if i go bow chain here i mean b bf i mean it's just better itemization
spread i can't go double like if i go titans
shun help help help okay i mean my word is actually
strong now like it's actually
strong
no titans on me i can't like no one's no one's going to shojin man shun for who
that's an
e deny me okay i'm stuck with this piece of but also like now since i'm i'm i'm
i have these two two starred i kind of want to just push levels so uh can i get my yasuo
back i'll just hold thre i mean i'm leveling two turns right poweres
make new day new also i need a wukong sa like one wukong i'm so
strong no ad is good but you you need uh you need three star duelist cuz these units are
like it's it's a good cap but it's you need the upgrades like you'd rather have six duelists with what the
you'd rather have six duelists with uh with three stars than eight duelists with two stars tell a different
t no it's actually good like it like like it's good it is good but like the two stars are not are
not killing and then like like titans is really
good on vol bear but like you you can't like you can't go titans cuz then you you're stuck with a shogun no one's going
shun but also i i can't even level i'm probably going to slow r 30 and if i find i'm going to slow 30 and the moment
i find oneu i'm just going to push you just don't play sage i mean
it's fine sage is 12% but doing gunners like the reason extend the dual is probably so good is is because you can
you can get away with three item or three like the dps on tr is insane it's
just that if you invest a healing item on a range unit it feels really bad but like the fact that this get 10% on the
vamp like that's like all you need like it's good
enough they could not break me
soju is a clear and colorless distilled alcoholic beverage it is usually cons consumed in meat it's
alcohol there's a tg umra plus one's useless there's a
tg man you know this tg this tg could have been
this tg could have been on a it's on a one cost right it could have been on a yu oh wait this story is not yet
finished out of here
byebye i mean i'd always rather
tg and now i just afk cuz i can go nine for wukong but i just afk until if i
find like two vol bears on one life i'll roll for vol also this doesn't me front l anym
what am i doing when life gives you sour bandle
berries make bandal
bru this volun is a beast like if it's three star volley he just just sits there tanks every one just goes
infinite but like you can't roll for one unit especially on level
eight is actually i'm least impaired i'm i'll roll post if
anything cuz i win
honestly eternal winter oh this guy is so strong
like like i've run over guinsoo but like since you know like this guy doesn't have guinsoo so my board actually gets dumpstered he's triple damage so i can't
even run him over like what the
like like usually like you can run over guinsoo aphelios because by the time his guinsoo
scales you scaled
harder tell a different
t i alone my f if i find like two vol bears i'll probably roll up from one
life roll lukong is good
too also i should probably just backline this one need to find like diana though
she need to deal some damage from me or think
something now you see him now you don't maybe i'll roll until so i'm not guaranteed
rong uh nah like i'll roll on loss at least in two i don't know it's kind of
big i lose my life here for no reason i'm not guing should you

i you b my destination is clear oh i
didn't roll help help help i have one more roll
please don't hit or i'm going to be
mad like h like i kind of needed to know if i'm going to hit cuz i i need to know what i'm going for i remember like m d
is kind of good like really good i'm not
going so the other unit is
broken bet and now i cap around three three item the thing am i ever going
nine this game nope i'm just zero every return yay least two this shop watch this
gg's wait how much it really do
four that's pretty good and then i'm cing on third it vol
bear count on third b
bear and le in two and hopefully that's strong enough to
win but like honestly is it kind of unlucky that this guy doesn't have guinsoo on aios because the thing is like if he had
guinsoo on aos here like don't i just run him over but he's like max cps i beat him anyway all right bet
byebye like it is
unlucky oh there is too yay winess
strength you troud
i mean i'm pretty sure this guy gets run over i don't think he has enough
damage or no he has enough damage but i don't think he has enough front line to sustain like he like kaiso probably
needs like two two cast maybe three so he can't kill my entire board in two casts i'm pretty sure he just gets
dumpstered all right so why is this guy
in this game it's an
encounter has a defensive component does he have an extra component no you can go
oh i can go i go heavenly plus one instead of uh oh wait
wait what wait what it's a third item on like what the do you mean why i
don't even have a third item no
prison and gg's oh
what hello
hello i'm coming for

you save your tear beautiful baby this reminds me of our
first up and over man it's all good i'm a beast not really
extended duel eight duelist
gg's

tear love i mean is my board even that bad it
actually looks kind of good
no my god you're bad oh yeah no you're right if you were playing i guess you would just make 30 like get 30 gold out
of thin air my god you're bad like what the like what i'm supposed to just pull
30 gold out of my ass like i have two gold left what am i supposed to do man of silence i mean yeah i mean uh this is

exalted oh no i mean there's nothing wrong like there's nothing wrong with being
cringe like it's all good wait
what i mean someone has to say
it might as well be me get in with your spiritual
side all right it teo game or ashe game never a dull
moment
i mean i have shiv like it it was guard breaker anyway un that's want to go tg play around no oh my god like it
was guard breaker anyway what am i doing if i actually i can go tg and then
and then belt bf that's if i'm playing towards ap flex but it's help is on the
way al this corner is bu half the time this is level six with gallo teo2
okay honestly i might as well wait one and see augment before i commit to a
side in darkness we find
ourselves 77 viewers game
77
okay well now if it's that then it's just
uh that's the 12 to
level i dropped the 30 to play what sniper for this dude
i mean i might as well wait the encounter before i slam that's not even true i mean it's it's never tg cuz i don't care about the belt
anymore i mean maybe i go guard breer but i don't sem my e cuz then i can go
chain and that way i shouldn't level okay it's fine i i don't want to commit to ashe
like what ashe with shiv it's not even
good and i have lilia like i can just end the game with lilia now right i go shun shiv guard and
then play wrong
glove i don't know i'm sitting here with
teo2 i'm sitting here teo2 with no
uh with no trick shot okay what do you guys
think i mean this seem i like honestly it's fine i feel like it's so good i already
i can hit any like i'm going e ah i mean three components i i i yeah it's fine yep
the last time i ate a plant was

never
how sh bar
i actually beat this guy what the is except by
us free exalted oh man if i got the lilia i was actually back
dadge 7 tv removed lock in add new one please wait
really not going to hit your units nah it's fine you have to hit something
all right ice cream i can just buff everyone i mean aus is more flexible ice cream is
okay shroud is also good team 60 health i mean attack speed is attack speed but
i don't really want to clump but i'm clumped regardless i mean attack speed is pretty good it's also a
f item i herald the greatest bless uh i
don't really want to pop it right now i don't know about building another tv i don't even know i'm going to hit a single unit this
game chances are i'm going to be stuck on this teo for a while but my board's actually
insane i have h is on the way blistering for and then i have shun ship guard i have
the like my my word is actually
good
cost three gold instead of
four i mean that it works for me i'm not i didn't even know it was this galaxy i just got
back radiant shun how much ap is this
45 i mean it's not warong cargo is
okay it's actually so cheap to
level zyra i mean like now i don't want to roll at
all cuz it's it's for like every roll is it's so expensive like this
to m rush too i mean i hold jen for
sure radiant radiant shun 20 mana per auto
blistering strikes it's like too cheap it's three
it's three for four so one roll is worth like
infinite good job everyone i herald the greatest thr two
is thrh two probably play diana jana this
game such
potential you forgot to
bow i don't really want to
spread all right are my items are actually good though blistering strikes so i don't have to worry about anti-heal
i have shun jg guard shun shiv tg front line item as
well i don't know how st as
well de oh no he's level 830 i i'm level
830 but his board is way better than mine also i took cho at this game oh my
god oh my god
hedge fund fast nine fast 10 oh fated vertical
fated i already have yu
ahri but it gives me a sunfire cape can i reforge this
eventually i mean it's too good it's actually too good it also gives me the kindred and now i don't have to
roll and then i'll just pair these two and now i'm just playing seven fated
syndra leas in or syndra
set
wait i'm not playing this not playing this not playing this
not playing this i have two
removers n it's fine
oh we are made by our
choices like radiant shun remover this i mean i can fade it this like radiant
shogun is
yes ah like i mean it's supposed to be r but
i don't want to commit double remover like fated this no i'll just put this for
now still exed three dryad wa how oh oh
it's cuz i have i can drop oh wait no it's fine i
am i'll probably drop i'll probably just sell the ornament eventually fated is the
earth promise tomorrow actually i'd rather fated l cuz it's a front line

unit wait another fated spat wait 1 two three four five 6 7 8
n9 wait and then if if there's a fated spat on on 55 i'm i'm i'm 10 fated
assuming i'm level 10 all right
i channel the spirit i feel closest
to like i kind of want to just go fast 10 though cuz it's it's the exp thing
like there's no reason not to go fast 10 i can go fated udyr as well like jenna dragon lord
invoker 39 to level i mean it's cheap as like i go to 10 who
cares i kind of need to hold kred i mean seven fated for sure if i
can uh i mean i kind of want to hold dude here for get the past it only
clouds the future i mean my bo is actually good i'm pretty sure i don't have to roll a
single
time like yeah i have my radiant shoen but like radiant shoen on syndra is like true whis ideally it's it's a radiant shoan
on azir and then shoan on syndra but also like i don't even want to fated my
azir cuz i'm pairing these two if i can if i
can oh wait oh you're right it's
not like i'm play ashless cuz i'm i'm pairing these two
right since my carry is not even a the power of a
dragon so i just play yasuo
this was your ashe okay works for me oh i'm
back i compare ashe with uh li or i can play ashe with a mumu there a set my f on
anybody this is free drad and behemoth this is uh duelist in dragon
lord but this is set i'm seven
fated like ideally you like h like i'll figure it out i don't want to hold the
order is given i can drop i can play withar instead of destiny halts for no no
one fated plus one fate hunts you
today okay i'll just fated this for now it
all right when the is perfect to go
nine or 10 ah it's
it's 76
73 it's like four turns from now honestly my board's not even bad though
i can i can fade to this eventually though radiant shojin fated with omn vamp but i want shun jg and and this
together seven fated a zero carry what no there's nothing wrong with eight
fated listen listen eight fated is good because this unit also benefits like what else am i
going to play man like radiance shun jg and guard breer together and then
shojin shiv on this but then if i go radiant shojin and guard breaker then i just go shojin jg
on this
he okay what the can someone
help like like what's the itemization cuz like i i i want the
radiant like okay there's no okay before you answer if your answer involves radiant shoen on syndra kindly stop
talking exist to be broken no disrespect but anyway
56 the last time i at zed was never
k3 meanie
what uh 470 next turn it's 67 and then next turn
is 64 so two turns is perfectly
inable i mean i'm actually mindblown that this board is still stable
like i could just not fade it the
aer that sounds like a troll though i'm not going to lie maybe it is is not a
troll like it's probably still fine huh i mean i'm just dumpstering everyone man this vertical traed uh
fated tree is not looking very
balanced it's 64 what's 64 divided by 4 uh i don't know whatever and then
whatever tg no fated plus one there's an uder to but has a moro i mean i'm going
to hit uder 2 regardless qss i'm down for another tg tg all my
f
blistering oh run our
life oh man looks like i just win for free it's all

good cuz i i'm pretty sure i just want a fated list okay yeah i i'll just fated
list fated drop the shitari too easy rem make
ashe but then if my if my azir dies and it's okay it does not look like it's
ded this guy got dumpstered i don't know who it was oh was
a i can also play four
uh so cheap your journey or die bro i have i
have no chops this is the worst legends are told in word and
deed
i'm not going to go zero though i can go fos as well do carry
this i can i can sell this oh actually yu is is exalted just
sold died instantly i mean it's fine like i'm i'm rolling 40 gold next you can't miss
sniper save your
undeniable this it's not fine this guy is looking strong as
this story is not yet finished like i can go list over
this let me let me remake this cuz i want to see if my removers i list over
this i'm just playing eight fated or seven
eight fated i mean i can drop kred uh dryad
no i'm carrying air i can play aphelios like what the except by
us
of i never
rest i never rest you have a
plan heart is empty without empathy set two with tg that's
fine thing can i play this no we are i have another tg if i want it i can
go gg if i wanted i go even troud like one even troud is that really good set
two i your like don't worry like i'll i'll fade in my list like don't worry oh
wait why don't i just drop this now uh but then i want to i want to hit a z to i wonder if this is strong enough to
win though yes yes is exalted ashe is
exalted okay your i'm not playing
legends are told in word and deed surrender my triumph is inevitable
i mean i can use the removers eventually i i'll just use it now
then shen gg guard
breaker oh let mo this here uh like i could move i could carry
this but it's not an actual carry ch sh on this like i'll hit is this is the board
i can drop a i can drop a
moo that move was just
warden
at last our asion is at i mean it's it's like
ah it's too expensive stick to the plan we have a plan aumu is just warden but
it's a warden for for a two star i can save there i can tg this as well if i hit a two start here like warden or
nah such
power okay i mean as okay i'm actually
kind of down to get omn vamp in this matchup i'm pretty sure my
set can't die if i omniv vamp hit with
me too
easy oban plus syndra and it just it kills the entire board
instantly he i already stole my uh
though like he he he can't even kill this okay it's onent for sure because
the thing is his board can't even oh holy he his board can't kill my
shiten wait i sold my ahri
please i have no that's too
expensive i want to pay to this now shun and i'll just jg guard breaker here okay
who okay so it's set with someone set in who syndra or set when thresh set in thresh i
don't need damage if he can't kill me like he can't kill me
yeah oh have a rod here
ah whatever i i'd rather take this than anything else like i have i mean he can't kill me i i have
45% omn vamp and armor and mr and gg's
unable set's full hp cra's full hp air's full hp bye-bye i'm
back
all right so where's the ahri oh wait wait wait wait please please please please please aos
aios
sp
well now now now i need to go and hold the aphelios what does aphelios look
like ah this is too expensive
it
please i just it's
okay golden like trying to paint
on wouldn't wish my f on anybody aos are calling aos i found re2 before
aos please
aos oh wait all right bet
gg's the entire board all fated
champions gain 300% of every fated bonus the
wait what wait bro come on
like like if he's going to ff you might as well just ff when i when i sack the board cuz he
was going to lose regardless like like if i have omniv vamp 45% omn vamp for
azir 2 syndra 2 and in like a stacked set like how the can he ever win you
know what i mean like i have i have 60 armor 60 r with 45% on the vamp on units that do like infinite damage and he has
he has wh lilia he can't even one-shot it and then it just it just non-stop like heals to full like it's an actual
counter but the problem is it's like it's not good until you you get to like the the giga board because you can't
just pair set one with thresh and expect to kill anything but like if you have everything upgraded like you're killing
everything you know what i mean but
anyways

like please i one roll i would have hit
oh please don't kill me please don't kill me please don't kill me please
undeniable
will be eaten first for the
darkness hello i think i'm dead i had s i was i had one roll and it
actually oh oh man i don't get
it also i need to drink some water my throat i feel like i've been yapping so much my throat like
hurts such a
waste this world needs hope okay it's
fine this world needs hope i actually hate scott
pudle watch there cuz i i can already tell that this spot isn't that high roll and uh if you don't high roll in
this you just yeah it's just an a well i mean that's not true you can
just you have to play rroll but like i'm not trying to play r roll that but also last game like how do i
roll 40 gold and then i don't like come on like i feel like that's a little unreasonable like it actually is
like isn't it a little
unreasonable all right honestly like it i just hard force ashe it
whatever man it i will not c
her okay let me tell you why it's good because the exalted is
ashe so it's actually good like i like it's not even bad it
actually isn't like i'm not even kidding this time don't worry like i can actually fit
exalted like it's not even bad uh all right who am i playing ashe
thresh uh is it should i just play alune then
alune with like annie or something something diana wait why diana is diana
good uh dragon lord sage up for a
showdown light him up is there a sniper
anywhere honestly this unit is so
useless like no sniper like i'm not playing this piece of
okay i h the two streak that's pretty
good j d the four bro oh jax forward yeah but like this
jack unit is is not the
best


let's go love
my board is so bad oh yeah high roll the three streak actually no maybe i
didn't oh wait there's wait there's a duelist here wait why don't i just play four duelist never mind i didn't i didn't
kill a single unit okay it's fine it's
fine i can also play fortune you know that i it i can play fortune
also let me show what the ink shadow is
bom i can use like infinite bf okay that's gone it's fine i can use infinite
bow and it's gone okay that's fine what okay it's fine gum blade guinsoo
like they're they're fine okay like oh
my

like i could go
duelist yeah it's not worth it like i can go for duelist but then i
lose it's fine it's fine don't worry uh i probably don't really want to
play exalted i want to play exalted for two turns but it's it's like i like
jax like next in would be du oh oops didn't even it's fine it's
fine bro maybe i should just go to sleep i i'm looking at
this i think i might be eighth
again oh wait offers you a weapon from different armories wait so what's good
here i don't really want artifact i' rather take support but like let's say i don't hit lock it
i mean artify sucks but like okay zeek is good or is aus better 30% attack
speed 30% for and 15 armor and
take okay do not
worry like do not
worry uh by the here
moment aren't you guys excited though isn't ashe kind of
fun okay i thought caitlyn was this
unit is not even that okay honestly this is just seats yeah she's fun like she sucks but
like she's fun fun fun fun
oh the last time i ate a plant was
never this one's got fire 2 three 4

least ooh solid warm up who's
next in darkness we find
ourselves yes i mean i don't i don't really want to play it for a while though like okay
okay it's fine i mean gum blade is
good there's ink shadow but let me just get some scks like i i don't want to
play i i only want two rounds of exalted and then i just 41 send it
yeah i like and then i can just 41 send
it oh but i'll i'll probably play it on on
these two turns right how do i how do i even fit it in i mean i probably
play okay am i just playing jack thresh ashe jack thres
ashe okay sure i guess oh
wait what is this story weaver
bruiser

muu oho okay i need to get the off this hex what is this
oh my also this guy's thresh to aphelios 2o what is
this
i s like using a gold if i don't hit i don't hit moners are
everywhere
that is not always a
release sh
do
okay not bad honestly it's probably worth it to 4
to because uh who the holds ashe like am i not guaranteed ashe ashe two for
free in fact this game it might actually be an ashe three diana diana thresh diana thresh
ashe oh
wait i mean i'm just saying i'm just
saying wait wait okay okay one
bow one bow the game's
over i'm actually back wait it's bow

anyway is it okay to just uh commit a porcelain or i how much how much damage reduction is it 60% i mean
okay
125% as 60% reduced damage like please all right one bow one
list game's over bro
i need oh no you can probably just run them over also like i definitely don't need raade
cuz i have zek as well right like 30% raade as stats aren't even
good they're not bad though like they're fine you know you know what raade sucks on yon people that saying like question
mark yon like off y y bro shut the
up wait what i i mean i didn't say it

all right i sack one i i delay roll i 42 send as much gold as possible i find i i don't i
don't mind being a little bit lower cuz like it's better carousel like maybe there's a list on carousel maybe there's a bow on carousel but either
way one l wrap it
up oh
my i mean i can go tattoo every third attack fires
a bolt honestly this is actually pretty good isn't this actually like b 20

and then i like last whisper last whisper gun blade plus plus this with six porcelain it's a win out is
what it is 55 all right bow please bow no that's
fine i don't need it until later it's all good
i mean i can reforge the tear as well cuz i can just go crown guard maybe i just get a bow okay that's

bombardment okay i'll just chain this for now it's
fine wake up time to play the game next round you're
right bro i'm rolling infinite like like yeah i'm like i'm like approaching one

choices six porcelain three exalted like yeah it's three behemoth keep
laughing nothing wrong with re

mr ad i'll go that there also flexible

congrats on your winning d2 soon you will master soon you will master then you could work your way up and consider
entering official riot tournaments mart get the back to work like it's fine k3
congratulations you cheat not only the game but yourself you didn't grow you didn't improve you took a shortcut and gained nothing you experienced a hollow
victory nothing was risked and nothing was gained it's sad that you don't know the difference bro like come on like it's my
first time up using slamming like it's not even that good like it's
not up for a showdown no you're not
press how come you're still not
sucked going on such a also by the way my first game of
the day you were lower lp than phoenix seto i don't know why you're okay bro we
don't allow phoenix slander here is clear like how come you're haed on
phoenix i mean that's not very
nice like i like i get that his internet dies every every 30 minutes and he's gaming from the garage and he can't play
at night cuz it's too cold but i mean like there's nothing wrong with that now you see him now you
don't i mean there isn't there actually isn't this world needs
hope bro this one unit needs the biggest buff what's his name
uh uh yor like holy this yor unit like i just like this it could be a one
cost and i don't think anyone would notice like would anyone notice if it were a one cost i don't think
so
watch
this watch this i kind of want to try this uh this one comp i kind of want to
try uh like okay how here's the
deal i'm going to uh i'm i'm going to uh okay let let me
hit master zero op and then i'm going to i'm just going to hard force this four ghostly comp every game this ghostly trait or like four ghostly
reroll at k3 so you your mother is over right now all right that's it prent you
know i hope your team will i'm going to like like not only will i
keep your laptop i'm going to take a photo of me pissing on the laptop and then it'll even have the name
tag press on it it just to make sure that you know you're not getting
it and then i'm going to drive over you're going to wake up oh that's
weird your car's gone what about my laptop oh i sent it
to milk oh that's crazy i mean i i mean yeah i mean like where
where did the car go who
knows also i could have played two out of three here highkey actually that's not even true
cuz you can also just jack is not even that bad n n i could have two out three like i could have scouted bro okay your
car's definitely gone now like bro i could have made 10 here i could have just played like three out of four oh my what the and then off
chance i
win wait okay well i don't really want to
play this one's got fire i don't really want to play a
felios actually are people playing filios in darkness or actually wait why
don't i like i can hold aos and play aios or i can hold senna and play senna
like am i a aos player
nah i want to try playing uh hold on what's
the board caitlyn aatrox shen
senna jax allawi i'm done to try
it and you just roll uh shanena what was
it
so you had a tournament and winners got ls instead of giving them to the rifer winers he is hoarding them and
laundering the money sad to see from a billionaire honestly who the even started this

ink shadow ghostly bro like should i just play gnar
duo bro i like i'm not a gnar player in darkness we find our bro no
one's playing gnar agreed yeah nah never a dull
moment okay bro just trust me like when when you see this when you see this four ghostly and if i can make it to six
ghostly like this tra like it sounds lame but it i don't know it's so
fun like there's nothing more satisfying than a yoni 3 just getting one
bulleted like it stacks ghostly on it and just gets one shot
w oh wait i'm coming ian it's not even good like it's actually not good cuz you can't even play it until level like
30 h and then i yo boss i appreciate the raid i was
actually uh watching you in the morning too where i was i was watching cso and then i saw you at me and then and then i i tuned into to your stream
and then uh yeah i mean like yeah i appreciate the host thank you and and again i got you tomorrow i
don't even know if you're still here cuz sometimes like i ra someone and i just dip and then and then like they just talk to
themselves like me right now
probably i i could also just go hodge slam and just push levels and not play c re
roll
a pro is a pro glazer nope actually let me see what the
ink shadow is
protection
track being nice equals glaze yeah oh
yeah that's not very nice
oh oh s too all right bet okay i'm down i'm down just hard
force look for an ink shadow not not uh i mean depends if you're playing rroll honestly force is fine on chen but i
think if you're playing gnar you don't want anyone that can't any item that what the oh oh oh it's oh
okay
i mean i could just push levels for free like i have
hodge i've hodge ga last whisper like no one can kill this kayn i i'm a free level
10 i'm actually free level 10 nah like i'm down to just try it oh
yeah yeah i'm trying it
okay e
fast and
light oh find vintage
i mean aus is really
good it's fine like like like yeah i'm
five streaking but who the cares doesn't matter to
me when life gives you sour bandal make bandal
brew let me just make sure i'm not contested cuz don't contested i have to
push okay there's no gnar player okay that's fine bro i'm just sitting here on a five
streak with two full items on bench i'm a certified idiot like like don't i win this fight for sure if i even had a single item on
my board i mean yeah i mean yeah i do am i doing that's

okay uh monsters are
everywhere wait you think i can leave tattoo of protection on bench and i can
just like you think it's bugged ever or
no yeah probably not but i mean maybe
like like r's not awake yet right 9:00 a.m. they probably get into office closer to like 2
p.m. so like if if if like if if there's any
company that has that bug is probably riot
no
tattoo of
protection uh i mean i kind of do want actually like i'm down to just go like s
up because the items don't really matter like i'm just going to find vintage everyone i have tattoo of protection for
hp honestly isn't it kind of high roll that i got tattoo of protection like max health shield when i can go like the
armor stacking stuff it's kind of
good our wills align f today do i even have the board in my
page watch this i mean i hope so f hunts you
today this world needs
hope what i'm missing aatrox
aatrox uh and aaoi like i can't just
swap no oh i'm playing uh i'm playing uh for ghost through instead no trust it's
actually good these rollers just trust just
trust but i'm pretty sure you actually dumpster you dumpster the uh oh what's
up nard dog the uh the reloads but you get dumpstered by fast n but there's nothing wrong with
that for 20
seconds i mean i'll just uh honestly should i just reforge the lock
it just rng it i know but honestly my backline has
no cc or no no uh what's it called has no
uh like if i fight anyone that has like aoe damage is back just

come let me show you darkness like one allowing on top of
jack why am i even holding
this
i know it's my miss our will i got an orang dj the fallen or
make me stronger
how let's move i've got people to
inspire in darkness we find
ourselves k this

cur like i don't even want to lock it also who the do i
sure and then i'm i'm just going to put an item maybe i save the belt for anti maybe
i mean it's not like it's terrible but it's not like it's good like i'm blocking only my backline but i
guess man if i had if i had infinite reps
i don't know oh ghostly plus
one ghostly some unit
but then i i kind of need to get rid of i mean okay this is actually fine i go through this piece of
it's just always front
line and then i'll just go for honestly one lock is
fine uh belt cloak glove this is necessary level oh no it's
not worth it cuz you want to you need three starts for sure let me let me do a quick st cuz uh this is exalted
cuz your front line needs to be like somewhat tanky cuz it procs ghostly you also need a
g you're
cute oh yeah okay this is fine
okay and then i'll level four six closly and then what's my level eight
then i want to hit at least like i want to hit like sh shant then i
push ch is also not bad c to
it
glove your journey or die in mine watch this all right a l
to let me show you darkness i might i'm might knock over oh what
your r to 40 oh man i have glove glove i mean i could
just glove this tg this
like like antiheal i don't need
antiheal actually i i probably should have get one
antiem also what's his name was saying wait this guy didn't even die
okay that's that's cuz my entire wars one start i also know six ghostly it's fine like like i i think as was saying
and then morello dog like does anyone can anyone confirm is this ghostly is the ghostly magic damage post mitigation and
is it actually magic damage or is it already post mitigation can can anyone
confirmed no one knows i mean i can't i'll just ask more i don't even like the thing is i
don't even think he knows because asa was saying it's
not it's actual magic i mean i believe him okay also
hello okay this one's got
fire what the is this garbage bro i'm i'm about to just d
reforge this is
necessary and just just say it rng
it yeah i'm waiting for i that's why i'm not reing right now cuz like if i get another one that's like whatever i'm
just going to trip over forge whatever
it in darkness we find
ourselves all right watch this
gg's all honestly this is fine the

obsidian i i don't really want obsidian this though i'd rather obsidian someone
else like like i can't obsidian a single
target where the did my board go my entire board's
gone and also if if it is magic damage like if the magic damage actually does get in like if it's actually not post
mitigation physical into magic then it's actually
good i think it's fine it's my last
loss h like shent is a straight up demon
come let me show you
darkness hello am i going h rox 3 sure i mean if i don't hit shen 3 it's
fine like i need c three though and i'm level like level one turn i just got an irelia but that does literally nothing for
me darkness and
light
come let me show you darkness i don't have
anti-heal in darkness we find ourselves no shadow without
light i mean that is a okay i want to see
everything i mean i'll just put it on on kayn and then i'm just going to sell it later like i'll just remake for morello or
actually just play
morello okay i'm pretty sure my board is actually insane only make me
stronger like triple agus but the fight starts i just have infinite ghostly proc even on my
backline i think i'm druple leas

actually okay
okay thresh three it's fine this thresh is about to get dumpstered it's all
good
ghostly it's not getting dumpster that
fast holy holy i lost okay i mean but i'm sitting
on 50 gold like it's fine i have an item on bench i'm 50 gold like that's like it's fine not a problem not a problem
not a problem like i'm sitting on 50 gold like i can still cap around morg i can get
better units on on like i don't worry don't
worry this is necessary
i can move my tgs to a better

unit i'm losing some attack speed but i don't really want to not
corner my dude i mean i can just move this to the left
bro what wait
what like isn't ghostly cool as when the circle starts circling and
then they just get one shot
it's gone wait
what i got stuck i don't even know what to want anymore oh
my i can mana reeve or i can spawn a
but the has triple
agus yeah whatever it
oh oh i i didn't spawn oh i didn't oh i don't think i spawned
it it's quadruple agus like it's fine it's fine and i c on heavenly like it's fine it's fine don't worry troud
i'm not a loser it's okay it's
okay oh
my bro what
you forgot to
bow 225 ad quadruple
agus i i can uh but i don't really want to lose honestly nah it's fine it's
fine okay i just going straight to
10 also why don't i level here it's literally free to
level just yeah but don't you want jax in the corner this is actually tanky as
oh bye-bye it got two
autoed all let me see if my z did anything hey 1.3 not bad it's
worthless no can hold me this is necessary i'm holding i'm holding these
cuz i i can uh i can i can just swap but also i'm probably capping around like i could
go like uh nah like honestly like i'm kind of
down for this actually i should have one corner i kind of want this in the corner also i can even
bounce oh wait no i can't let's see if i hit an fall only
make me stronger
i just level all in next turn like one virtue i mean i don't
really i mean one virtue is actually pretty

good probably just s next
turn is it dealing any
damage is this bug even doing
anything 879 what do you keep oh it's it's fine vintage i'm just getting these things
i'm just legends are told in word and
deed the power of a

dragon okay why the do i have a lent on my board hello wouldn't
wish my f on anybody sure i mean that doesn't do anything either wait
what any twar i'll just
play such a waste uh i want to hold this for the replacement cuz if i hit a two star i'll
move i'll move items off of my my dude
even way heart is empty without empathy i mean silus 2 is sil to time to take what
do live your journey or die in
mine i'm never playing anymore

one trout uh i'm going to save shrout this turn though because i'm going to move it
to actually tg i have an extra unit right
is it supposed to be wukong it's not does anything take back your
spirit i'm seven ghost reaper plus one on uder mythic oh

fine are you having fun over there do you want to do later okay i mean it's still good it's
fine i mean like i i i kind of wish i didn't get fine vintage cuz i think this augment is just op as
but but the thing is like like i can't tell if it's fine
vintage or if it's like six go like six go is actually good like i like this this f vintage is
just op as

and it was actually kind of close like i died with three like i died with negative3 hp but let's say i survived
that round and then i leveled they don't i actually win the
game
wandering i got zezy rod

not this story is not yet finished okay
why stationary
support oh it wait gained six gold the all right what' i
get mythic
fortune back coming
true
are calling like i i don't want to slam because there's actually a high chance i just play fortune into
guard so i'm not i'm not sing maro like i i'm not playing fast n with mythic dragon lord like there's a high
chance i'm just playing like i might play dragon lord tempo like five dragon five dragon lord
with morello like that's the only way but like let let me
see there's civer and tom kenchin the
exalted except i don't have a single mythic
unit

fault i i'll know what i'm
playing this game is over this game is over it's actually over it's actually

liar this like look at this
guy
like i don't even care if i win like i lose my fortune cash out i don't give a like i'm just trying to save hp cuz like you can't i can't like the thing is
someone else might have a uh mythic plus two but what makes wandering trainer so broken is that i can play 10 mythic on
nine because this target dummy stays with me on level 9ine you know what i mean yeah like this is a guarante
first eight free rolls this turn there's a
cog i might as well heal three turn three

way one way the game's over come on at
morind of our hello
wait
please just
one stick to the plan we have a
plan

good
please
please i don't even think i s time to get the
armor oh no i did hello one
way like i don't want to open s cuz like if you look at my board it's not even bad so that's why i'm not open selling
cuz it's like like is my board even that bad i have a rock on 2 lilia
too is my allels
in
but like no one's upgrading the the stupid ass le in hold
it like i'm not upgrading that trash please oh oh
okay is empty without empty all right this game's over gg's
gg's
acceptable feel with
me

i mean if you put it on this it doesn't even work cuz the the the rakan doesn't
doesn't get the
pair this doesn't get the doesn't get the mythic either oh my i'm not taking gold mancer like the is

that wait i actually i think it does but why does it look like it has no hp but there's no
way let me read this item 70% max
health ah who cares it doesn't matter that was beautiful baby this reminds me
of our first it is my into which all travels
end pandora who cares like what i'm i'm getting a third item on for ran
here
al whole board never mind i'm not getting a third item but i mean it's fine i just got
three i just got two alas whole board like all this hp 10 armor 10 mr and then
also get alas on this like like who cares it's all good
and i can 10 in two turns no 10's a lot it's actually a lot
don't worry 150
hp who my team actually does
damage i this say items though 1.5
1.2 okay
whatever you there what do you want to do
later fades life
fades you forgot to
bow okay well if i can survive two turns i i hatch way to and i can level for
heavenly whole board what is it hp oh i'm down to play a mal fight for
even more hp but i'm also down to just play s wait it's just sraa the do you mean three alteris 25 armor mr gives
this omn vamp so the biggest reason it's

good no like you can actually lose like like it's not even good 10 mythic is is actually not good
undeniable like it's it's good but like you can actually
lose like like 10 story weaver you can't lose 10 p you can't
lose but this one you actually can
lose
this is necessary it's too expensive not to make
50
that was beautiful baby this reminds me of our first
days two
no i'm one off of leveling i don't even have nico too
like please i'm three gold off oh no all should i just sell
then like isn't saka a guaranteed
win whatever
nah this guy is is probably my hardest match up though cuz it's t only three he's a guinsoo though so it's like
kind of useless you sp over there what do you want to do later actually he he wouldn't
be able to win without g though okay never mind i want for sure okay over
the
be my can i even have
sage i should have i should have roll okay i'm trolling like why am i not rolling and then leveling
hello yes i'll just play better than mal
fight
oh i'm cool with spreading but i should at least put this here oh no i'm losing some attack speed are you having
fun over there what do you want to do later oh
no the way guy in the pool he just died from
22 he's probably just going to ff heart is empty without
empathy his
way it's all good


first time chatter here but long time vod lurker started playing tt for the first time last set and made it to
emerald thanks for your streams you taught me so much of what to do of what not to do thank you i mean your emerald
like relax
buddy my gf and i went on a dat last night and the mood felt right so i asked her if she wanted to marry me she said
yes but then she asked me what kind of ring i was going to give i'm going to give her i was broke so with a bitter
smile i just right now she's just mad because she won't be getting diamond anytime soon bro i'm ending rank one
like what also i'm getting kind of
tired i only s like 5 hours i did like a like i i was out for like 24 hours again cuz i was watching
uh bct oh sh i won the game not yet
finished

oh actually yeah wait should i be roooting for px or sentinels like i don't even know like i like both of the
teams but i don't like i don't even know who i would be rooting for i'm pretty sure i'm going to be rooting for px
s get in with your side
i mean i didn't say it

though wait can you just play senna amumu plus one for free is
this
ah yes
yes well i'm i'm probably going to st the first round anyway so i'm not going to
slam watch this i can actually play this this chogath cogma
roll like low key but let me let me just sack cuz uh
i'm sitting on cho pair mali pair cog pair jax pair these p are way too
good this world and also i don't mind stacking for carousel cuz i might also play aphelios r roll and i just go for
bow but if i upgrade some stu i can go iie sunfire i just go bow and
carousel it's it's i can make 20 but it's not
worth it like this is this bench is way too good i s i yeah i can win this actually i think i won
anyway okay i need to get the off this corner this is pissing me
off like what even is this
i just gave him an extra unit kill for fun i mean i can't complain i got sharing is
scaring oh
i could have waited to see if i fight someone weak cuz if i fight someone weak then there's no
reason to slam cuz it's encounter next oh i made three gold this
turn what who will be e
p i think i lost oh man
i mean fake loss like i made 20 how is this augment legal it's
not gives you the next augment
immediately ty kha'zix
what snipers gain 15% attack speed gain a caitlin in a cog
mall after snipers have attacked a total of 12200 hex's
this isn't even the 32 one liar honestly
it oh i don't i don't have faith that i'm going to win my board is not that good don't
worry

oh yeah you don't get patient h at 32 yeah you're
right i'm definitely playing for sniper this game
and i have what 15% starting attack speed the bow's gone the bf's
gone okay that's fine glove like for sniper like the reason
i'm i'm pretty sure on for sniper guinsoo might be like true wh because i i think
if you if you don't win the fight in 10 seconds you already
lost like like what would it be ashe of felios and like what sen kate maybe is
there is there another cyber missing oh another filus the
like what sniper am i missing oh cog i mean i'm only playing
four okay it's wor on ashe oh okay it's good on f that's cuz you're playing rroll fos
right let me just search against it's only good on aphelios wait it's good
on it's good on kate guinsoo
kade long shot it's only bad on ashe so guinsoo is
good on every sniper except for ashe
what creatures is not i mean i guess like ash's ability doesn't procet then you
just lose up
time oh oh this is exalted wait i i want two turns of this oh you're right actually if i play it from now all the
way
until if i play it now all the way until 41 i can 41 it cuz one two perfect neal
and then four makes another cut off
i'm down and then i just 41 send it to zero actually i mean don't i just want to
play ailio
so las doesn't yeah i think it does so i'm just going to be playing all the snipers i
think what's your name like i'm pretty sure no aphelios 3
this this this shit's not very good in darkness we find
ourselves i i want to do less damage but more attacks but then what if my front line just
dies okay yeah cuz the thing is it has to be like range you
know does this even work oh it
does the wait what
down wait that is not good
like it's actually not good cuz everyone gets one like this guy got a tg probably
oh no i don't know what the he got but like everyone gets something like this guy got two component anvils and i got nothing i got straight up
nothing what the

okay aos
or now why don't i just roll on like why don't i roll on eight but i still go for aelio
3 that sounds like the
plan
never a dull
moment
32 i i can play nautilus i don't really care about the
lilia oh wait level 740 does this all look
balanced okay but also i got gold as well so it's like fake oh
man something good i'm
useless who is this guy even talking to hold on give me a second slash
def no shadow without f oh wait i got two diamond
hands i mean that's not bad and a mogul smell and an eternal
winter wait what the i just got one two gold from augment
four gold here f i i'm getting six gold guaranteed what the
gambler's blade here snipers focus
here what's not
guaranteed but like
wait
it doesn't really matter it really it really
doesn't
uh there's an ashe but like h it's fine chain's
fine you get how much red a little
bit i get a free
ashe like this is half last st like it's this half last whisper
like this is not enough cuz it takes way too long to
cast all right when the do i get
my mal fight all right senna amumu plus
one kayn le and silus this is neary
fa and i got exalted in at the perfect timing like bro it's a perfect 41 i'm about to load into 41 with ashe
three or ash2 okay is ashe ever just broken i
swear every time i play ashe when i'm like actually given an ashe spot it feels
so good but when you hard force ashe it sucks like i like i swear ashe is not
even that bad like people are talking about ashe but like it's i mean it's not it's actually good i
think hello
10:42 in your elo yeah yeah i'm getting talk i'm getting talked by phoenix it's actually just
embarrassing yeah you're terrible buddy it's all good
i'm getting yapped at by phoenix it's just sad
sad all right how many hexes 114 what's going
on what spirit reveal our
way okay please i just need 60 hexes
also i should probably remake aphelios there's no way i'm going through his
tre did i hit no up for a showdown i the greatest
i'm ashe too zero
rolling


on this now do i get it now or do i have to wait until
the i have to wait until the next round are you stupid
ah okay it's fine bro i think i'm going fast 10 except by us what isev level 860
my board's not even that heavy hitters keepers tons of
stats i have a worthless behemoth here but it's fine this is exalted so like i kind of want to play mal
fight gift from the
fallen man i hate tons is healing orbs
better no one's no one's not taking wait what wouldn't wish my f on
anybody i herald the greatest
blessing spirit reveal our way what the is going
on damn i might be a beast oh wait i should probably fated some people who am
i fading well no matter what it's this oh it's probably it's just this for hp i just call
it what the i mean doesn't this ashe actually
look kind of good i mean you're right it
does who are the exalted it's uh the ass mal fight oh i should have bought kayn but i
mean not really it's this uh ass mal
fight oh senna and
amumu but like my max cap right like isn't it better to just drop
amumu like let's say i drop mali for udyr 2 and i drop amumu for list
2 oh i forgot a pair oh wait oh
sorry sorry wait what like is it even better to drop exalted
though too
easy cuz like you're telling me i'm not going to be playing any of the juicers like i'm not playing li quay azir like i
can play five exalted at 10
it five exalted at 10

this guy still 100 streaking what do i have a glove i want
tg i feel like there's no way that's better than like actual units that do
damage
cuz i could i could go
like let's move got people to hold
on
wait like let's say it's udyr 2 over mal
fight like don't don't i want to play around like a li udyr maybe
wong maybe air maybe way maybe
rakan dragon lord
and life i don't know man like i can't tell if the damage boost is actually better than oh actually can't isn't it
like whatever man who the knows not me belt chain chain cloak my journe only
beginning 60 to level starting attack speed i mean no matter what i'm playing
i'm playing wukong 2 for sure oh honestly i shouldn't even try
try too hard

this
cuz this is i can lose fated which means i can drop thresh oh you know what it is you
just lose four sniper
no i just it it opens up
thresh stick to the plan we have a plan it opens up threat
thr kate thresh kate and
aphelios wait i might be a
genius and then you just play every single legendary in the game too
easy
spirit reveal our way i can even drop amumu as well oh
wait oops i can even drop amumu i kind of want to go for a set items this set's actually going to be a
beast uh actually i can go tg and then i have stair
ax or i can go ie guard breaker but honestly i'm hitting wukong 2 for sure this game
and i'm com of down for a
tg okay wait i'm actually kind of excited
my board's actually be so capped like the highest c i can even drop a mo and just say warden actually nah probably
not i can go le
in le
diana rakan monsters are everywhere
wait i can even play irelia as well with the leas in if i'm playing leas
in honestly why don't i just drop my
augment and just carry
irelia what 20 xp for free the
10 roll for what i'm going straight to 10
what but the thing is i kind of want to play exalted right with sen
eh make sure this guy's not going for three start or something that's why
i lost last
game on
me your that's okay who cares you forgot to
bow bro it's 20 xp 20 xp 10 rolls it's the same
thing but the thing is like there's no way i don't make it to 10 this game right the power of a dragon
uh this is heavenly i mean it's dropped this this this one two three i'll hold call cuz what i get six
sniper actually i mean i wouldn't even be playing if i get sniper emblem i just play four sniper anyway the
uh 32 34 50 52 is perfect
i i have enough money to just send the next though i can actually three start legend this game i
think too
easy bro this ashe is not even bad never mind that is a fake loss
though 50 to level
or to be 50 oh wait what oh no it's still 52 yeah
yeah oh

wait hello wait one second i there's um with uh
with that but bro i get free last whisper okay like you can't tell me this game's not
over oh yeah i should pre low my bad my bad it's
okay not perfect who the is wouldn't wish my f on
anybody i neveress i'm not playing diana that
legends are told in word and
deed i have a le and two on bench but like i i don't want to drop i
don't want to drop this this this until i have better stuff like until it's two star but i don't want to go true zero
here the h i'll just drop it like who
cares
our asion is at
hand uh heartart is empty without
empy you got
spirit it i mean it's not stronger until i hit
what's it called until i hit more two stars but i mean it's fine wait i'm for
exalted wait what
oh oh oh oh it's it's cuz i'm trying to i'm supposed to
drop wait why don't i just play five exalted
then like okay like it like don't worry like even if it looks weaker i'm about to hit every single two
star in the game like it can't be weaker don't worry my irelia did the same dps with zero
items okay i'm dropping this ass augment out of here and out of
here it's all
good what is this yeah

deed never rest wouldn't wish my fate on
anybody legends are told in word and we can be
heroes let's find some friends

g back so i'll sb if i'm if i'm closer to one but i want as just hold i mean
this is this is dragon lord and sage it's not only stage is terrible dryad is not that good though i mean

good art is emp without
empathy i'm one off of l is he holding
li no i'm not i'm not one life yet don't worry don't worry bro i'm not one life relax
relax like i'll like i'll sell one on one life cuz on carousel like i i i can still hit
hold bro they have zero gold hold what i have your you're cute
today i'm going to sell this uh are you what do you want to do
later you know i'm pretty sure i can win this game if i just have two star wukong and two star the thing two star roon
instead of ah like
cuz like these fights are actually like this fight's actually close as
i'd be one
offset there heavenly plus one as

legends are told in word and oh bet surrend my is
inevitable

awayes
youres

like it's impossible it's actually impossible all right just in case just
in
case am i dead oh okay it's all good
gg's what the please please
i went to sleep for 11 hours and you climbed from gold two to plat 4 do you suck
no s no one is promised tomorrow it's my first day back after a 28 day
hiatus and i just get harassed this story is not yet finished
s
ahri new day new friends save old me the
is this
garbage no one is promised tomorrow
i alone deide my
fate my destination is clear wait what exalted fated
duelist if i play exed the entire stage i can for one it
no one is promised tomorrow oh wrath of the
moon i was told that this augment is broken wrath of the
moon stats augments wrath of the moon it's a 3.98 and what you just play
alon alon
y oh what the witness true
strength death is not always you're telling me i just don't play exalted i that's
fine
br it's actually kind of embarrassing how bad gor is like how is this unit so
safe hunts you today wrath of the
moon h now but there's no way it's not that
right like there's actually no way behemoth
fated i my level five is probably going to be
fated with uh these two and i just like yeah i just don't play at this game i'm
this
f but isn't it kind of boring playing
roll no
really better than going i didn't go wait is it is it really three times in a row holy it is
888 oh man
yes
i don't really care about feda that much honestly wrath of the moon cuz i'm
probably going to find an alune it's fine all right i win this round umal
dryad
okay if i bought forward this game i'm going to sleep like there's actually no
way do you need help bro i'm like i'm it's like my
scores are so bad phoenix comes in do you need help do you need help bro
shut the up how about that wait what
what oh oh i use infinite bf sword at
least it's like half shogun half iie half bt not iie but half
bt have
shun technically have g but not
really i get ex ed in for free 9% bonus damage is there something like way
better exalted i only have to i only have to play this two turns
right and then that way i have a perfect 4
one
i mean it's not like there's anything strong right
now
darkness the moon is b
new i win this anyway right yeah all
right nice i can just play weaker then it's all
good all right wrath of the moon umbral champions deal 4% more damage every
second they continue attacking an enemy resets when they swap targets gain a darius and a
yoro like i could play four four umbral umbral
umbral i don't have to play yon cuz i can also just play alum primary we'll
see honestly it might actually make yoro broken as
well like low
key cuz he's just like attacking one unit and then he just has 100% increased
damage it can't even be bad this story is not yet
finished annie tr to keep up
you
so what the oh morello feel is bad for me or
something our wills alive do i need to level to beat this
guy you
think
nah okay also the stats say that last whisper on yon is actually
good also should i just lose econ to hold yorick like i can actually go yor 34
fore like it's not that much econ it's
fine wait umbral crown vertical
umbrel redemption and a york and an umbral plus one like
it light him
up don't laugh don't laugh the stats say it's gigaby on yon
but i mean there there's no way i'm playing vertical vertical reaper this game so i don't really care about my yi
that much like no
laughing
yes
oh we oh what
the wait
what i'm pretty sure even i can go first this
game y
silus oh yeah actually i don't even know if i'm going first but i'm definitely not going like
eight wrath of the moon six
umbral
i'd rather go bow tools has y as pretty mid i and just
place and are built 2x as often oh yeah but i mean you have to oh okay can hold
me i mean you have to build
it like you can't tell me i i would be on 100 streak like without this last whisper like it's too good like b
glove and it doesn't uh conflict with alune also how do i even play this cuz i
kind of want to like slow on seven it's not even perfect r this turn i i don't even want to lose
duelist i could slam gs but i don't really care if i lose my
streak and also i don't even think i'm going to beat this guy actually i probably would beat this guy i don't know about 7 gs
though like like it's half red buff half shun like half like whatever i feel like i'm going to lose i can play not annie
but annie is are kind of good cuz kill so i don't know if i i won anyway
i'm starting to think this this wrath of the moon stats don't lie because this guy's board looked pretty
good and his entire board just died
instantly oh the grave is your
home i could lose one gold and just play silus now i'm down fu this it's four
gold actually it's not one gold like that's not even bad and it's just yon over this piece of
annie it's like probably or over this shen and i play
kayn or i can also just drop this worthless trana someone else but it's not like the tr is
bad i should do an
infinite unless people are going for alune 3 because if if if alune 3 is contested i don't really want to roll cu
i don't really care about yoni 3 it's more so alune
3 but i don't mind like yor 3 alon 3 and the other d
three what the what the y what's going on

here i find them unworthy oh and the
nio every flower bls to be seen
i'm going i have red bl
now last whisper i have bf bf
belt wait where's my
it's
fine like no healing is fine i have 1k hp shield okay this is broken this
wrath of the moon because the thing is like you just attack the tank your spell does aoe and it just hits the entire
board for aoe like is that balanced no
i want something to buff the alon i mean i don't really want little buddies i'm buffing some trash like
stylus and some other that no one cares about when lons the carry threes a crow i mean it's not hp when i
have that thing i mean it's not that when i have hp i mean it's not that crashes dummies it's i mean i get some
extra hp it's not bad you have my bow attack speed on these
units
shentu shentu sure our wills align i mean i have three
star but i might as well wait cuz i'd rather
nico the the other d get it as well i i need
shojin i'm not even playing reaper
this y has to be true wh so how the do i kill
this i can't ah whatever that's okay bf shogun probably
like shun red buff plus one nashers or something but i probably want like a ap
item blue buff on this and i get another shito or i get a red buff i mean it's
blue for sure oh what the what the all right bet my destination is clear
monsters are everywhere like blew up on this
unit i have two eos some call me evil shall i prove them
right uh i don't really want to go zero i'm i'm looking at my gold my gold's actually looking pretty
solid or not my gold my
hp also let me sc out and see how yon are gone cuz i think if i want to win this game i actually need yoni 3 like
three out of yi
three
a okay i can actually hit everything for sure like don't worry like it looks like
i'm going eighth but just wait what up what's up s i'm going eight again not really i mean this game is a
guaranteed top two i need a
shogun
there's a y i i guess i don't need yon or or shojin because i can also go like much
rather take the yon go naal sch like it's an invoker so like shogun's like not that good cuz it's
probably still going to be four autos whereas invoker makes it so it's five autos so it's one auto diff like it's not even
good i have two shter e

go that's
okay and that level for
kayn but yeah i might as well just go for uh three star everything there's zero
the thing gone if i had zero item yon i would not
go for yon but i have i have last db it's
actually not even bad like if you think about it right
like let's say you have bt is bt even going to heal 1k
hp in the fight probably
not oh
bet like i might as well go shine oh no i i think i i don't think
it's umbral that's broken cuz six umbral is not that good i think it's wrath of the moon cuz like okay okay like alune
attacks the tank four times right for 4 seconds or whatever like four whatever you just get 16% damage amp on your aoe
spell like what wait i feel like that's like isn't
that like too good like i'm just sitting here attacking some piece of never mind it die okay but that's cuz this
guy's front line is so trash that's not even my
fault okay his front line is so bad that i i lost wrath of the moon value
okay i mean it's fine put you on the other
side wait you're kind of smart wait what the all right thank you wait a

second i'm coming for
you
another king we all end the
same forget the past it only clouds the
future the last time i ate a plant was
never this is the where i mean i might as well just level
next her and send it like this is what i like to call fake loss okay also should i gs yon or should
i gs alon which one sounds
better yeah it's probably why the not going g like this is a fake
boss he only just tp's backline half the time alon actually
alss okay i'm just going to level and send it it's like there's no way i miss actually i should probably roll in in
time actually n there's no way i miss it only cls the future it's oh my god i did
my math wrong we are made by our choices
my chel experence i feel
closest like i could go uh like i could drop this umbral
azir and play or and give and give yon an item oh wait i'm kind of down what
the
fallen only make me

stronger do i just um cane
probably like is here worthless let me make sure i give kan an
item trash trash okay now what drop this garbage ass
darius for set and then
what i don't know who
cares hello oh okay thank
you bro this yon is a beast too
easy what the
wait umbral plus one oh wait i need umbral plus
two it's not even good like i get umbr on a zer and then i have opens it's nah that like i need items i have one
item here one item here the going on i can go guinsoo i can go
dclaw i can go blue buff protector vow i'll just go guinsoo it's
fine and i'm just going to have or give items to kayn
now okay holy i i might actually win my first
game and i'm probably going to finish items on silus or is z
kayn i don't i don't even know which one's better it's probably just whatever items i get bro it's not even whis man
stop
laughing like the umro shield is 1k like come on is pt really going to heal more than
1k or not umal is is bt no it's not like whatever
who cares it probably will at the restar
but like i i feel like healing is not even better than ginu because i'd rather just do damage uh there
is wait i also need third item yic what i need third of them
yorick two items four items i need five items br where the
is cho at
i mean i if chath appears and i get two full items from it like oh god okay i'm pretty
sure this is the next strongest i can win though i think i hope
so oh
byebye we are made by our
choices what the bro my worthless ass darus to
2.3 what okay i'm sarry to think this augment is just
broken
oh he executed
oh all right perfect oll is actually right now but if i sack
two i mean i might as well sack two also this guy has one
set okay well it's i know it's not a york
item i have red buff here i can go i can go jg on
silus or i can go guard breaker on
kayn okay oh no it's not a it can't be ster
cuz the thing is i have 1k hp shield so there's no way it's uh
yeah like you rather just do the damage oh
not bad yeah i'm down i'm down for list to farm i stock
one who has the highest
hp i mean even if this has hp i don't really want to up my

positioning warden
bruiser order is given you want to do later this
guy's playing z why does it look like i a dumpster
save your tear i got dumpster wait
what oh he julo to per right
now spe spe reveal our way
stick to the plan we have a plan legends are told okay where is this
stupid ass list i don't even know why i'm playing this i mean i'm willing to play randomiz rakan but i kind of want
a list to farm an item cuz if i can get one belt item it's actually a huge spike
also how come i got dumpstered by okay i'm starting to think clones are reverse bugged like
how there fated emblem he's basically all
ap did i get the hodge oh holy thank
god all right where's
l oh it's probably too late for
this i don't even know why i'm playing i mean i could go for way not
really oh i should i should probably grieve like grief this
for so he can hit z
too my what's it my k died
inantly oh i think i lost save your te wait he hit uder to but no no it's cuz
my king died instantly like i can win this i think
bro off fl bls to be

seen what the is
this
de too i mean it's fine i move i i moved the yor to the right side so at least my yor has to thing
first yor
d my york died instantly beautiful baby like please can i just
get one first like please just one man i'm losing to udyr like i talk about udyr and i lose to it nah
like this is a fake loss again not
really what the oh
de i mean it's not like this unit does
anything okay actually i think i need to just position this into the corner and i'm
fine
left any legendary two star is fine their sealed by
my i mean this it's too late you idiots oh ready for
this he hit z too i think i
lost

ah there's no way it's this cuz the thing is this d is just getting one shot there's no way it's h it probably adap
it seems a lot better though oh bet all right

byebye

what the is this this guy's board is so trash i i feel
what this is just embarrassing okay i'm pretty sure it's just spark early game is so op and then
now he's just i don't i i wouldn't be surprised if he's on a 10 loss like his board is just so
bad oh my okay qu is actually the coolest unit in
the game too easy wait
wait
wait wait
what


it's
oh what the oh nice it's an exalted unit fated
behemoth oh it's it's impossible to get though

never a dull moment also it's so highroll to hit thresh because the thing is yasuo and ahri are broken it's just you
need uh fated but it's not that good cuz i'm not hitting anything else the
such a was i am living
change
i could go bard two three
four like everyone has a gold
opener i don't really want to like ah like this is the worst
yes such a
waste like iine playing teo
roll also i'm i'm like i'm not playing the right units let me stand on 21 no things

ep i don't really want to play b
either like the four random monos here i i what the is this
hello
nice
you this world needs hope i could make econ by
selling i don't get it okay nice i won the game i mean like after this i just won the game all right
gg boring never mind no i
didn't not boring okay no i won the game i won the
game
i can't even make econ here if i don't win or i can't clutter if i don't win
please please please please please i need this win please why does this guy look so strong

bugged out hello it just didn't
cast
what what the okay well honestly i don't think it mattered but like but like wow i am

going
i mean last second i just
level
this story is not yet finished but i mean i'm not leveling that
much like it's fine i can actually hold these like it's fine
this is actually so
bad like i go shen and i just play
towards
now i can actually play i just play towards lilia this game and try to go fast 10 i don't know man like i i
already know this game's an eighth get me
out i've
exalted if i want to play it not

really i go where the trouble is al i could play s
instead i mean i can i can play mythic
these mythics are so
bad like but i'm playing towards
lilia what the f please oh my
god is econ less important oh no it's just uh i i've cluttered like i i have all the econ in the world it's just i need to win rounds and then also like
dude this this kha'zix like everyone else has a gold opener and i'm just sitting here just
rolling like i not rolling like i i can't make econ i can't just level for no reason like ah this is so
bad like you lose more econ by by
pumping take back
but this is the last turn but like it's fine whatever i i'm pretty sure i can't even
play i want to try to play towards quay if possible i don't know getting mythic in
this this is kind of sh i i might as well
pump and then i can like i'll just pump again like it's fine oh
wait wait i won the game wait why i'm going straight to 10 all right bet game's
over i mean you can't clutter this
round all right boba thank you for the sub and
frost thank you guys bro you can't you can't you can't clutter on neutrals
man try to keep up
okay i mean my final board is going to be li l gallio saka plus all legendaries and i just
went out works for
me l gallo saka civer oh nice this gallio saka
cer uh plus plus irelia
maybe nine free shop r
rolls teaming up gives a
component i don't really need choy rollo 18 gold later
and i can also get fortune in i feel like it's so much weaker
though bro this set is actually too
hard what the is going on
i'm zoe what's your name
uh i am good
like i could go fortune in instead of one of the behemoths
you think that's worth no on five streak what i don't
know why i asked the am i watch this i mean if i lose i'm i'm kind of down i guess
sure
okay i just play towards way
is this set good yeah i mean it's actually i mean i mean i say it every time but i i think exalted is carrying
this set i think without exalted this set would be not nearly as
fun but i think with exalted it's actually kind of
fun this do
to uh do i just come my r now cuz i can i can go nashers
already oh holy
i just play toward way
i probably am playing no prison
me vol too it's whatever i me i can get i can get fortune in as
well like it i lost anyway
all right i'm zoe what's your name so why did i use my my
r monsters are everywhere roll the
four my front line just turned to
trash oh my
god ah okay i think i just got weaker i mean
i know i mean i got weaker for sure but like okay it's fine it's
fine
gall
laka okay i'm not to take out fortune actually that's not even true cuz i get
free shred
you2 i can go tom bench
for for bruiser with
gallo travel awaits can mods make an exalted command
ah i i'll do it i'll do it it's not that i got it size doesn't mean
everything okay and now i just afk this stage and
i'm back
on and i'm playing towards h i can also play towards
irelia i don't really want to go gum
blade like sunfire dclaw i don't need shad
cuz i'm going to be playing this but if i do go tread ra go probably
sh come
closer bro like a one unit loss who the
cares oh wait i mean if i have lucky ricochet i i just end the game with that means i'm just ending the
game with four trick shot which is fine like this is so
op and then i then i just upgrade my front line
and then i but then on teo two
carry i don't even know how they can
offer that it's actually
embarrassing oh i just need to upgrade my front
line okay then i can just go i i don't really want to go gs though gs
sucks wouldn't wish my on
anybody once i get items for kaisa the entire port just dies instantly i up front line and then uh what front line i
go in gallo gallo b
sraa i can also just play
this saraka zyra

wukong
let me show you darkness ashe
to bro my front line
um hello okay i okay i mean it's fine
whatever what the i don't even know when my friend's going to be good
either a champion duplicator i
lost because i don't really want to dupe the
oh god cuz the thing is like my cap's not even high cuz i'm capping around kaisa and like all this
trash i mean i could just dup the kaisa no i'm not doing that the
front is so
bad i will not
okay i got a cloak that's pretty
good that's actually really good okay now i can lose
fortune what is this nothing what is
this annie is annie
set the on on this
dude okay it's
fine like don't worry it's last loss who the cares all right stop one more
than my sa i i can't i can't can't push luck cuz
it's like if it roll six i'm just dead so i'll just take it it's
okay oh what the it rolled a one all right bet oh two
gold roll the
two that's probably better than metalist just
fr
gallo
civer like don't worry like it looks like just just wait just wait like stop laughing okay last loss the
moment i get kaisa 2 the moment i upgrade my front line i will wipe their board in 3 seconds like just just wait one
second their entire board will just be melted in 2 seconds
yep okay i'm i'm basically pre-leveled wait this
unit burdens of the
past five autos i just need two autos i win the
fight okay my front line needs some
more they were so close legends are told word and i never
rest i'm never play thaty to
up i'm not playing really the wouldn't wish my f on
anybody no prison can hold me we are made by our chice so where the are
the gallos
chain three story lever i just have a random
i mean i remember playing a zer i mean zer is actually pretty good i have golden eco but it's like fake
news i remember playing syus no i mean i can also just not play exalted this game like honestly do i just not play
exalted i mean i have barred for free like there's no way like it's kind of good oh wait i probably should have
cluttered that turn h it's okay only beginning
annie
sraa okay this dude too okay am i just not clearing this turn or
game i guess for warden for warden like i can just not play these i
mean i probably just keep the annie cuz it's annie like i mean
exalted like i i mean i okay i probably do want to play ko
though oh break i don't have the single target to kill this
i need truck for sure though oh actually i i be
it i can't even cutter unless i want to sell like it no it's fine it's
fine okay wukong 2 is wukong
2
i mean i i don't really want to lose but then desire i mean sage is
well i can't even clutter again my
board like exalted with sraa i don't have
gallo i don't get it i have golden ni on
bench no but annie is actually tanky as
i sell the annie i just
go sage plus
one wait there's altruis plus
one not like i'm playing riven
though i don't really want i like sage plus one it's ap does nothing i want steraks okay that's gone i there's altrus
plus one stage plus one altrus plus one
h say harder right
now can i even make it to 10
here i need the shredder i can't play the
game
i just need front line if i go gallo over
this if i can make it to exalted i actually win a
game remember playing these no i can make it i can make it oh
great like one gallo like it it looks like i'm not close but i'm actually pretty close i
just need to survive one turn and then i need to find the gallo cuz it's just gallo over garen oh wait then i just don't play i
mean the nautilus you doesn't even do anything bro i could have just went
kaisa 3 this game hello like it's not too
late moners are everywhere
like for what like it it's not too late for any3
either all right it my
turn sck to the plan okay as long as i don't die here i went out it's it's hard to take 15 though it
actually is
okay yeah it doesn't matter you can't die and
gg's wait would i have died at 40 no no i have to get 5 like i'm too off you can't
miss i have golden deco as
well random wuhong 2o doesn't even do anything i don't even have a heavenly
in i mean i can sell
this okay it's fine y tim oh one off oh
bet i mean it's not even
good okay is there a front line item i'll just go pt it's
f like i can go gallo plus and i lose nautilus
for do i even want
exalted oh man deserve
first i
am like is that even stronger i feel like i'm losing too much front line
i mean g is probably better than something oh probably better than zyra omn vamp i mean 15 ap for backline
that it might already be better maybe
too never like this is my board like i could i could lose
this for exalted probably it probably has to be
saka though
it has to be ro up i think i'm not playing beast
shooters it could be list nah i don't really want
list holy why does it look like i almost lost what the
holy oh
bet this is the most undeserved first i have ever

seen

i i just re oh my for example i know he's going to
start
blabbering this guy is just sitting here
spamming when are you bitching about fortune start honestly fortune start's not even that broken okay it's broken if
your opener sucks but i think fortun is like lowkey balanced because the thing is if you accidentally win it's actually
punishing but like in the pre like the previous ones like a lot of times like yeah and exalted makes it so like
people's caps are actually really high i don't know i i i think it's
fine h never but now like if you win like it's pretty bad but i think if you
win with like heart steal of the other traits it's like who the cares also the for units are not that
good so yeah kha'zix gnar lux aos
annie two
yos cusing sar lux
never yes
too i alone decide my fate causic gnar lux a feel
any is this m there's not that much burst set i actually think m is like going to
proc but eternal winter uh i think they said it'll actually f f
yep such a waste i know where the trouble
is oh switching
gears okay you know what's a balancing
issue there's a uh there's this sharing is caring this is a tear one by the
way oh yay like oh my like bro they just
bro read this augment combat start you gain two gold and you're like what you just gain two gold to turn for free the
wait okay i need to lose though hold on how do i how do i get the weakest board
possible i i ought to lose the first round oh
nice this guy gives me a gold my destination is clear i
am cuz you still get uh you still get um the three gold for
losing the first
round yeah i don't know you just get two gold a turn i it makes no sense i don't
know watch this and then now i just play strongest for the rest of the
game like du for sure i mean it's probably kics for sure
yes what does heavily give crit and mr
armor i feel like i need some
damage i mean it's not like that does anything okay i hope i win this round if i lose this round that's kind of unfortunate this guy looks kind of
strong ah no i'm pretty sure i'm
stronger
this see unit is actually so good like tanky so it's
unable no one promis
tomor bro i'm actually so rich what the i made two gold two gold three gold
three gold i've been making 50 every turn if i lose this round i i still
don't mind losing like am i playing story weaver
here crown guard belt lose oh it doesn't matter if you win or lose now you win
you win you lose you lose i'd rather just play strong this but just make sure you lose your
first round cuz that like sets up your entire game
cuz now like the difference is like if you win you you get a gold for winning
so it's like the difference is not that big but like first round like you haven't made any econ so it's like kind
of valuable and then let's let's say you
like you you make it to four streak then the difference is only one you're just saving hp for free no promised it's
fine
am i just going story weaver plus one i have like no damage items like it might actually be story we plus
one i could also go sunfire and
flex but like flex what i have a
scat f like i could also go dryad plus one there is gnar in
there and if that's the case i can go gnar
cosics i i don't know about dr plus
one i'm down to just go sunfire and and just flex like like a dy plus one
nah
that i got
30 oh wait i have oh i have fated
hello oh wait this is actually so good for me what cuz i'm rich as
i mean shield for sure ap attack
speed last second like i'm just going to econ up and then last second i'm going just send it to seven all right bet i
mean then then i might as well just try to make econ here it's kind of
important i mean garen i don't care like riven
oh yeah or should i just buy the the
y i feel like is better
than like okay gnar like let's say i go gnar aos
annie that's not lux lux aos annie i can hold a gnar but i can also
hold death is not always a
release winess oh man isn't this spot looking kind of good like illegally
good bro i'm i'm level eight for free like this okay this encounter needs
to like i'm pretty sure they should just remove this isn't it like kind of lame like let's say you you hit it on
like 43 and then like like there's just like you're rrolling and then oh what's this like everyone just gets free n
you're sitting here like what the game
plan like this one actually sucks i can go heavenly plus one
heaveness me and just play like heavenly
flex like rounds remaining one i mean i might as well just pump
it's three gold i'm not losing gold like like what huh okay
gg's
coming
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 i'm level 730
old never guar pump the oh no no it's not worth it
cuz you lose too much money actually do you even lose that much money wait let's say i just pumped a
zero i mean it was worth it if i took lunch money here but like lunch money and i just
bully the noobs but then what the does my augment i i i have mogul mail crown
guard sunfire heavenly like what the is
oh lord find
vintage complet items left on your bench i mean i can't i can't like i can't
leave but i don't really want lunch money but i don't want it's fine the
last time i had to pl was never three fated is too
good let's say go and any oh there a forgot to bow let's say i just dropped
darius i feel like i need to it no damage you was a
pleas the stage damage counts by the way so don't be that idiot can't like don't be that idiot
that takes um lunch money on stage two that is
terrible oh nice okay honestly it's not i'm just going straight tonight uh is it the fated unit bonus
for everyone or only the fated units or just the connected fated it's uh fated units and you select by pair so right
now it's giving these ap and shielding but the shieldings are kind of good is this stronger probably is
i oh but i lose some heavenly sacks on i lose darius too actually is darius doing
stuff oh oh i'm starting to think darius is doing stuff 20
mr oh i can't heavenly that wait what mal fight oh i think my darus is
actually doing stuff wait that's a heavenly oh oh wait i think my dar is doing
stuff this is
archinist you forgot to bow
can i even kill this gnar i hope
so oh
nice okay can i play exalted probably not i mean the thing is
kha'zix is
heavenly man this exalted trait i actually can't glaz r it enough
it actually makes every game feel like i'm like excited to play every game
tear
what is this nothing like it i just level i
mean it's kind of cheap and i got six heavenly in like it all right bet level
830 wait
what and i just commit the remover i mean i'm probably just going to go seven heavenly with uh wukong wukong
diana and try to go fast 10
ian i have bogles and lunch money so this cosics evolve needs to
all right
bet i don't want i'm not
h level 850 this is
reaper i mean i get ap whole board lost time i ate a pl uh like doesn't do
anything behemoth ah like it
is this stronger i lose some
ap i lost some ap and a lot of other stats i think i
got weaker i got weaker i got weaker oh no like like it's 200% cut off and i also
gain like 15 ap whole board and it gets like more cut off of the other stuff i think i got weaker
one more cast it oh wait oh i definitely did not get weaker them but i feel like that's lucky that i
h okay never mind i did not get weaker f spoil the
chase uh maybe i did get
weaker the long time i pl was
never
it's 20 ap whole board 20 ap whole board and a little bit
extra of everything else i mean i could just level and just
and not roll a single time but i have lunch money so i kind of do want to roll if i do
level no one is promised tomorrow to the what the is
that bro
what i mean i already have sunfire i mean i mean you have to make
it like it it's
fine saka
qiyana sage
ribbon b b like if i level i should probably roll
instead of just leveling and
sitting especially cuz i can switch in gears as well and then also have lunch
money teaming up salvage bin
bobo i mean sal is actually not bad i i want stationary i don't want
that no prison can hold me i just spiked
i have a remover as well keep
up i i want heavenly for sure i'm cool with red buff i don't
really want that b ch i got another boat i mean i don't really want to commit them remover
yet who the can i
sure okay
sure uh okay 10
here
i mean it's fine i don't want any of these try to
keep up 20 exp and 10 for your rolls i mean
i'll take the 10 the i've got people to
wouldn't wish my fade on
anybody ah this set unit is such it's straight up fake news ready for this
wait do these the do these disappear by the way the 10 free r
rolls uh okay i have bow cloak oh
no all right bet uh the thing is i i can actually get some hp
though like i can stack this through the entire game and i cap around set but i'm probably not capping around warden
anyway i'm not capping around umul anyway it's just dio dio
wukong le in maybe plus one irelia
maybe
exist okay it's fine oh oh rakan oh it's rakan diana rakan tiana wukong
orelia your c isn't saying the right thing it's just i'm participating oh

editcom oh wait oh thank you i don't know which which sub did it but thank
you or not sub mod as you

set it's fine whatever i mean i could use my rolls but i can also use my rolls on
10 switching gears
seven it's okay i mean there's no way i'm capping around like this tr these trash
units like when i go 10 i'm about to just piv my entire board but instead of going fast 10 i should probably just
roll like what the is this like i'm not even close to
10 actually i guess i am cuz i can sell syndra i can sell
or like i can sell my entire board i'll probably just keep war
actually i have tg okay i definitely want a tg never mind this
c the power of a dragon is this fated unit
silus tear glove
like it's fine it's fine don't worry i'm just not sure this i have free rolls i don't need that much money no
one is promised i st one i'm just 10 next turn and it oh a silus stick to the plan we have a plan what
the this is we are made by our
choices wait what i'm lost

anybody i think go double healing i go ga i don't i don't even know what my items are i'll go ga r buff and then
i'll natur someone else like it looks like i'm poor but it's fine like it doesn't matter cuz i
have lunch money i win one round i just win
out seven heavenly and then i'm i'm definitely going to make it the legendaries cuz the the ten cods are
like iliev i mean i could also just go even troud
it's not like i'm playing irelia onbody the power of a
dragon time how many free rolls do i have what's going on over here is
necessary like the a ear this is how dragon batt but who the
do i red buff yeah he is here cuz i kind of want to cap

around i kind of want to cap around uh is isn't it just j over that and i
just go for dlord assuming everything's upgraded like like this stupid
ass or but i need a two star to carry
the oh actually i can play irelia as well
oh no i i kind of want though i mean irelia 2 is irelia
2 i can also go ud to but i kind of want n i don't really want to play for lord
is that bro i can three star legendary this

game uder oh nah uder that guy sucks
i kind of want
damage like two with with a irelia two is probably already
better okay rock on too i might as well hold ch the spirits
i feel closer like i could just drop the thresh
now or not this
wait something's not adding up i'll just jg this for
now i mean this two this dude two star is actually kind of good something's not adding
up just right st oh i can go ginu
i mean i i don't think it matters but what's my strongest board
like irelia 2 is definitely better than than 3d lord right like the le
in right
probably holy i'm so rich plus oh no i have ke
like it's fine are i can also just go h like h is actually good like the or
this or doesn't do anything all right this like i'm might as well just okay you know what i'm probably playing this it's a free two
star wait what the how the did i get a component wait what oh oh
oh i' rather have offensive items
like i i i can replace like a random play two is actually
good i can lose le for irelia replace this as well this way too actually
good i me diana's good it's sage
plus nah this ud your unit is a straight fraud we can be
heroes i mean this is fake like even if i have the
thing i still want even
tr i have i have too much money i i ch the spirit i you're closest
to i me i don't like into but it's fine i'm too
rich fix the plan we have a plan i channel the spirits i feel
closest
to

let's move i forgot to upgrade him oh
my my now last this i don't need that
i was thinking about g but i'd rather just go g somewhere earlier and then i have rod like
honestly i'll just go spark as well
of s sure oh my there's a saka oh
my sorry fate is our deny me no
longer strength of spirit
okay well now
what okay this is my
board spirit away i have your back you're cute today what my wukong died
instantly the happened hello wukong wait what i think i
lost wait
what okay that's cuz my wuhong died instantly though maybe i shouldn't
solb is he holding me here by the way cuz if he is i can't even hit no
this is necessary it's too late to h
paint okay it's
fine this is the lord are you f looks what you want do l

acceptable that was beautiful baby this

reminds i don't even know what i want i what did i even take hello

anybody stick to the plan we have a plan i mean i can play like zoe
no all right i this is my board
your tear oh this is not looking good why does it look so bad
oh all right bet it's all
good

oh i'm an
idiot i might be an idiot
all right
oh stay
down rexi senna yorick okay i i feel like exal is not that
worth this game because like if there's no four and five cost like the is this you think i want to play around
this garbage not really never a dull moment or is it
worth it i don't i don't even know why i'm asking you you asking you guys you know i have 100 games on pbe it doesn't
look like it but like i'm kind of a
beast stay down up for a
showdown i me no one's trying to play behemoth watch
this i think i have to though 100 gam on pve like that's pretty
good good show tracker but there's no tracker
man for i need five games for there to be
tracker such a waste you forgot to bow oh this trash of
treasure what is trash of treasure assuming you actually play the game it's a 4.72 how at what cost
3.98 how oh i'm pretty sure fader crown is just
broken but i don't have ahri or the other dude and it's kind of boring
that that i mean shopping spre is probably broken for sure uh like trash
to treasure is actually good though nah shopping
spree behemoth okay you know how i said i was not going
to play okay actually never mind i'm pretty
sure am i just playing y this
game uh i mean i like
uh i don't know what i'm
playing
uh i mean i have shopping spree so kobuko invites you to dance with the
more i mean don't i actually not want the
reward cuz i mean i don't want to give these guys n these guys
nah cuz like i i i have like infinite like i
i don't even want these guys to scale a
okay am i just playing bard this is holding three bars for
sure i what else am i going to play
right okay also i don't know why i'm not playing caitlin instead of like i i just
playing bard you forgot to bow ah the thing is
this guy's definitely holding three bars i think he's playing bard oh
god bow bow chain glove i me i have shopping spre but
still the problem is i don't really want to
slam no he can contest shopping spre is not that good it's like fake it's like fake
good i'm pretty sure i want to play kate it's actually fake
good i mean i could also just play like a
felios and then that way i i hold the shen and i just play towards the felios i mean either way is it against you
regardless like regardless of what i'm playing i should be going against
here and then it's iie if i want to go uh but i
also like i just play towards aphelios or i mean if i'm playing towards ailio i should hold the
thresh so should i just pre-level
then just hold everything i don't need that much
money the the game
plan okay i think i'm just playing
affiliates
okay oh i mean db is good but it's not like
uh
and if that's the case and i i kind of want to hold
chen wait i
don't like dv is good but it's like i can go gun blade plus like gs or dv or something
or i i don't really want to send
yet gro i've been waiting and then if i'm playing aphelios i
can just play like c york for sure right not using oh yeah i'm saving them
until
like sen like sen yor wait s a yor for free wait s a york
cra wait what the wait what this is like the best aus
game ever wait

what
oh no i have shopping spree like you like i you you probably want to lean towards roll oh i don't a i
don't really want to uh like just don't
worry like i could also just not go for thresh three i mean sen3 like 73
cares like it's fine it's fine like whatever i just 41 and i'm about to load in with
aphelios 3 thresh 3 exalted game's over i herald the greatest
blessing
target like shen 3 i'm i'm going to hit shen 3 for free i don't really care about c3 i
probably won't hit cuz it's exalted anyway but i'm i'm probably like shen 3 aus 3 thr rush
three but then i feel like i need one more carry gold here is really
good back i'm kind of go for sh this
game i find them unworthy like db plus
belt death is not always a release oh this is
mythic dv for sure and then belt plus
bf some counters though so i probably won't sl yet why am i so poor
yes syndra senna
yorick you should be building tft ranked so early into the set you should not be playing this is the time when the pros
are actually playing will definitely outplay you it's best to wait for the pros to release the guide so you can follow them
bro i come back from a one month break expecting like oh welcome back soi
and it's there's not been a nice message and my scores are good like a
second place that's pretty
good second place this world needs hope all right
jwel lotus best friends crown
guarded slight of hand slamm it and 12 exp now after each player
combat if there are no items on your bench h i'd rather just have combat

blade glove chain rod chain glove belt i mean i have two of these things i
could play this instead of
i mean this unit is actually mid like like it pretends to do stuff but i guess i
have i mean i can also just not play shen i kind of like or like
sh uh like i think i'll use my rolls and then i'll evalate whether i even want to go for i can go lucky gloves
actually especially with uh what's it called i have an extra glove
here all right let me roll until i herald the greatest blessing okay aos
too okay i just don't play shen and then now my level would just be
ink shadow like an aatrox is okay but this is
ghostly that's fine and i mean i definitely want a
lucky cloak this dude i could lucky glove syndra as
well no this doesn't do anything also i
could put fated on i i'm pretty sure i want damage i don't need front line my front line's actually
fine and then i'll just go like i really don't want to go sunfire
cuz i can just make this item save your tear oh like it's a three star
unit okay i mean does my board actually look pretty good what's the in
shadow protection my is actually
fine i don't even know how many rolls i have
left no prison can hold
me
like this dies and gives hp to this
belt pions like not that good i mean it's good should i just go
sunfire the f bonus is 10% bonus 25 yeah i'm
done damage for my only
damage the thresh is like whatever it's not it's not the problem that's the problem like i gain 20 armor and mr like
i'd rather have 10% damage onos is only that like i have one carry which is a
problem uh um i mean i could go moro and just doal
carry but the thing is moro is like i don't think i'm hing c to this
game i'll just finish the sunfire then i i don't know i i don't know if sunfire is that good what it's exalted you just gain
some damage and then you gain one exp per turn i can sell it whenever let me let me sc how many oses are gone i like
i i for sure should be rolling on seven this guy has three
though isn't there a fated guy or no no spirit reveal our way i could also
just push no it's not worth it cuz i also want thr
three also should i should i be holding my next in the even is my next
in maybe i just go for all 3 as well it yourney or
die i don't want to sell these
guyss i'd rather have a damage unit though like a random
silus i'm getting dumpster onear everything this is 50 what the is 50 streak oh no
no okay what the is my next
in also i don't even know how many rolls i have
left all right like like alune ink shadow like the
ink shadows are so bad though like kaisa with no items like vol bear no items these are all i don't want any of
this garbage no shadow without fight i'm definitely not playing
this i mean i'm out of rolls but like i mean i i i i need to go for thr three
push i going some this maybe i should have held yon on the
roll down that's i mean kais 2 is kais 2 i
guess dryad
invoker the dude just got
eaten okay it's fine it's fine fake loss i mean drad's like not that useful
and then this unit with no no items is also not that
useful last time i ate a plant was okay it's probably like like k is zero items does that even do
anything umal for for nothing i mean kais is definitely doing nothing protection useless oh it's fine
the greatest
bless okay well i'm about to send it 31 hp i'll probably send it and then i
hopefully i can level cuz i still have rolls next turn right i could have just missed like 30
units here your journey
for i will not hold
back okay i'm about to level next turn i me i could go
protection like i stck one and then i just level next turn and then just use my rolls and just
hit what the okay syus syus or kaisa does anyone
know s
kaisa i mean protection it's not terrible i feel like they're they're
both useless i just don't know which one's more
useless protection is like some hp uh like okay it's fine
whatever such potential i'm just going to use my rolls
and then i'll evate whether i want to uh you
that is not i'm going use my free rolls and see if i hit uh the thing
monere i mean if it's two i'll probably play two star i'm out of rolls not
work i mean i get umber roll bro like nah that like come on man i'll just
take protection like like bro like doesn't even do anything it's not like it's even staying alive for more than half a millisecond so i don't know why i
didn't hold kais i got to have kaisa 2 okay well honestly kais
one the only way i'll roll on eight here is if i hit uh h is still pretty
decent i board actually looks pretty good i i'll roll on uh oh actually wait should i just go
force sniper at nine or is there something better to
play like ashe plus kate
nice
what i mean this better refor something good or i'm going to be mad
oh i that's pretty
good no one cares about this piece of is that even stronger for
sniper i kind of want just go nine i don't care about
this what's stronger rex aumu or for
sniper that was beautiful baby probably for i'm
going to go as it after i'm
items bren 20% bonus damage relative to the
thing and sniper is okay it's but then the other units there's
umal umbral is fake actually there's a there's a uder too okay i'll take
that i was going to take a syer item rabbid on but here
too it's pretty good
okay strength of spirit
okay this zio is actually a beast now and then and now i just cap around
tindra and i c on thresh three for sniper or for exalted drop this piece of
anything else i can
play kill this off asap
i can just play random list as well why play set oh set set's like fake
like set i feel like set's not good unless you're high rolling so hard and you find set on stage four bro that unit
needs like 400 ad to do anything i swear he like pretends to do stuff you think
like you think you're like getting some like wet dream by just uh by getting infinite stat stacks yeah he's
not getting stacks for like he doesn't do anything he just sits there and pretends to fight no like just trust
me the unit sucks i want to see everything he like pretends to do stuff he's actually so
useless wait list over kaisa l over
kaisa ashe over senna level aumu no wait
that's three arness i i don't even know why i'm trying to play ashe it's not like ashe does anything did my
uh this ka does
nothing trick shot this also does nothing that's fine i'll just i'll just play the first see i don't want more i
need more
damage bro this two deer unit i wish deer was slightly better
with uh with tank items i feel like it's kind of lame that this unit like it's
like like a damage but he looks kind of tanky right forget the past it only clouds the
future but he just like he procs ga i don't even know i don't even know what the this like the first time the
spirit walker drops the fig that he unleashes the rage within healing to full health gaining inre increase movement speed and changing his ability
from ram slam
yeah that the moment of
silence first message what i i might as well just level and use my rolls f is
this oh it's free rolls
never never a dull moment
spirit reveal our way oh i kind of want to just go nine or 10 like i can i can just level for for
this actually does it even do anything like u doesn't really do anything also
it's not going to do anything for the next year i'm not leveling for ink shadow didn't do
anything i can just level to 10
for a moment of
silence like what for what the list that i
sold spirit reveal our way
like it's argonus and porcelain but also i could also just like like it's not like the set does
anything oh i can also level for for allow okay i should probably just
list all right i just level for list and call it
okay okay i mean like this looks like a win
yeah tg on all end the
game all right bet it's just another
first must press
uh
uh it's 76 to level next turn and i'll be at like let's say i win
the around 66 i mean i could probably just level next turn i don't i don't i need that
much money or i could also just use my roll on
eight cuz i feel like thres three is better than list two especially cu my list is zero items
i'm probably going to go for ashe item anyway okay why does it look like a
dumpster sa wait what the is going on
here wait what that was actually kind of close oh wait is it 76
level oh no i had to stack one more this dryad plus one fated oh i can
go five fated y i that's not even
bad and then i gain what damage damage and ad so now it goes to 50 ad and 20%
damage oh bet wouldn't wish my f on anybody oh
wa it is 76 wait what i can't do math if i stock one more is it 72 ever or
no wait wait i get one from exalted plus two
72 and then that way i can actually roll i don't need the money that who
cares who do i fated oh
ashe all right so 50 it gains 50 ad mind and then what 20% damage that's
actually pretty good all right
bet lev
10 ah it's just so boring like when you win for free it's ah it's just so boring
man like ah
boring i'm going actually hit thresh three on greatest bless wouldn't wish my f on
anybody you got
spirit well now i'm rolling for nothing that's
okay though
right no i mean set is fake it doesn't it doesn't actually do damage like it's good if you if you find it on like stage
four and you have like an hp unit he's like a fake unit he's actually
f even if he has like 100 sacks too easy fin was it wait wait
this set actually kind of popped off that's actually 58 there like it's fake all right

bet
